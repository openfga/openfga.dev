# Introduction to <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/>

<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> is a scalable open source authorization system for developers that allows implementing authorization for any kind of application and smoothly evolve as complexity increases over time. It owned by the [Cloud Native Foundation](https://cncf.io).

Inspired by [Google’s Zanzibar](https://zanzibar.academy), Google’s internal authorization system, <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> relies on Relationship-Based Access Control, which allows developers to easily implement Role-Based Access Control and provides additional capabilities to implement Attribute-Based Access Control. You can [learn more about different authorization concepts here](./authorization-concepts.mdx).

## Benefits
<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> provides developer the following benefits:

- Move authorization logic outside of application code, making it easier to write, change and audit
- Increase velocity by standardizing on a single authorization solution.
- Centralize authorization decisions and audit logs making it simpler to comply with security and compliance requirements
- Help their products to move faster because it is simpler to evolve authorization policies

## Features

<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> helps developers achieve those benefits with features as:

- A [Playground](./getting-started/setup-openfga/playground.mdx) to learn how to use the product effectively
- Support for multiple [stores](./concepts.mdx#what-is-a-store) that allow authorization management in different environments (prod/testing/dev), use cases (internal apps, external apps, infrastructure)
- Support for ABAC scenarios with [Contextual Tuples](./modeling/token-claims-contextual-tuples.mdx) and [Conditional Relationship Tuples](./modeling/conditions.mdx)
- SDKs for [Java](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk), [.NET](https://github.com/openfga/dotnet-sdk), [Javascript](https://github.com/openfga/js-sdk), [Go](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk), and [Python](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk).
- An [HTTP](https://docs.fga.dev/api/service) and [gRPC API](https://buf.build/openfga/api)
- [A Command Line Interface tool](./getting-started/cli.mdx) for managing <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>  environments, test models, import/export models, and data.
- Github Actions for [testing](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openfga-model-testing-action) and [deploying](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/openfga-model-deploy-action) models
- A [Visual Studio Code Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openfga.openfga-vscode) with syntax highlighting and validation of FGA models and tests
- [Helm Charts](https://github.com/openfga/helm-charts) to easily deploy to Kubernetes
- [OpenTelemetry](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/configure-openfga#telemetry) support to integrate it with your monitoring infrastructure
