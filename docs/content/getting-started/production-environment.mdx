# Running OpenFGA in Production Environment

<DocumentationNotice />

## Preparation

If you have tried OpenFGA locally, decided it works as expected, and now want to deploy it to production, we recommend the following preparation:

- Update the configuration as follows:
  - [Configure authentication](./setup-openfga.mdx#configuring-authentication) on the server.
  - Enable TLS on the server.
  - Enable production logging by changing the `log.format` in the [config.yaml](#configuring-the-server) configuration file to `json`.
  - [Disable Playground](./setup-openfga.mdx#playground).
- Add a rate limiter interceptor (for example, [in the server configuration](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/openfga/openfga/server#Config)) that protects your OpenFGA server against bursts in traffic.
- Add a logger interceptor (for example, [in the server configuration](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/openfga/openfga/server#Config)) that sends logs to your logging platform of choice.

## Database Performance Implication

To ensure good performance for OpenFGA, it is recommended that the [database](./setup-openfga.mdx#configuring-data-storage) be:
- Used exclusively for OpenFGA and not share with other applications. This allows scaling the OpenFGA database separately and independently.  
- Indexing to improve performance, especially for check

## Tuples Operation with Authorization Model ID

To ensure reliability while new models are developed, it is <strong>strongly recommended</strong> that 
- [Check](./perform-check.mdx), [write](./update-tuples.mdx), [expand](../interacting/relationship-queries.mdx#expand) and [list object](../interacting/relationship-queries.mdx#listobjects) be performed against a validated model by specifying the authorization model id 
- At the same time, updates may be performed on the model and testing may be the new model.
- Once you are satisfied with the new model, you may switch to the new model either via blue-green deployment or via canary by switching a small percentage of check, write, expand and list objects with the new authorization model id.
