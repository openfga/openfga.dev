# Running OpenFGA in Production

<DocumentationNotice />

The following list outlines some guidelines and best-practices for running OpenFGA in a production environment:

- [Configure Authentication](./setup-openfga.mdx#configuring-authentication)
- Enable HTTP TLS or gRPC TLS or both
- Set the log.format to "json"
- Set the log.level to "info"
- [Disable the Playground](./setup-openfga.mdx#playground).

## Database Recommendations

To ensure good performance for OpenFGA, it is recommended that the [database](./setup-openfga.mdx#configuring-data-storage) be:
- Used exclusively for OpenFGA and not shared with other applications. This allows scaling the OpenFGA database independently and avoiding contention with your application database. 
- Bootstrapped and managed with the `openfga migrate` tool. This will ensure the appropriate indexes are created for any specific version of OpenFGA.
