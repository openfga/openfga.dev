# Running OpenFGA in Production

<DocumentationNotice />

The following list outlines some guidelines and best practices for running OpenFGA in a production environment:

- [Configure Authentication](./setup-openfga/docker-setup.mdx#configuring-authentication)
- Enable HTTP TLS or gRPC TLS or both
- Set the log.format to "json"
- Set the log.level to "info"
- [Disable the Playground](./setup-openfga/docker-setup.mdx#playground).

## Database Recommendations

To ensure good performance for OpenFGA, it is recommended that the [database](./setup-openfga/docker-setup.mdx#configuring-data-storage) be:
- Used exclusively for OpenFGA and not shared with other applications. This allows scaling the database independently and avoiding contention with your database.
- Bootstrapped and managed with the `openfga migrate` command. This will ensure the appropriate database indexes are created.

In addition, it's strongly recommended to fine-tune your server settings:

- The server setting `OPENFGA_DATASTORE_MAX_OPEN_CONNS` should be set to be equal to your database's max connections. For example, in Postgres, you can see this value via running the SQL query `SHOW max_connections;`. If you are running multiple instances of the OpenFGA server, you should divide this setting equally among the instances. For example, if your database's `max_connections` is 100, and you have 2 OpenFGA instances, `OPENFGA_DATASTORE_MAX_OPEN_CONNS` should be set to 50 for each instance.
