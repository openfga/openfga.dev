# Getting started with Okta FGA

Okta FGA is a scalable authorization service for developers that allows you to implement authorization for any kind of application and smoothly evolves as complexity increases over time.

Inspired by [Google’s Zanzibar](https://zanzibar.academy/), Google’s internal authorization system, Okta FGA relies on [Relationship-Based Access Control (ReBAC)](https://docs.fga.dev/authorization-concepts#what-is-relationship-based-access-control), which allows developers to implement Role-Based Access Control and provides additional capabilities to implement Attribute-Based Access Control. Okta FGA is based on [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev/), an open-source project owned by the [Cloud Native Computing Foundation](https://www.cncf.io/projects/openfga/) for which Okta is a core maintainer.

This guide demonstrates how you can get started with FGA by managing the basic relationship architecture for a shared file system.

## Create an account

The first step in working with Okta FGA is to create an account to access an FGA dashboard to manage your stores, relationship tuples, and API calls.

1. Navigate to [Okta Fine Grained Authorization](https://docs.fga.dev/) and select either **Log in** or **Sign up**.
2. Select **Continue with my Auth0 account**. If you don’t have an existing Auth0 account, you can create one at [Auth0.com](https://auth0.com).
3. This screen prompts you to set up an FGA account for use with the FGA dashboard. Fill in the required information, including a **Jurisdiction**, which is the geographic location for your collected information.
4. Fill out the required fields and select **Submit**.

> **Note**: On first login, you are prompted with the option to take a guided tour of the Okta FGA dashboard. Feel free to walk through the demo or bypass it and come back later. You can always access the guided tour by clicking the **Guided Tour** button at the top of each navigation section.

## Build an authorization model

An authorization model defines the permission model of your system. As mentioned earlier, the authorization model is the base layer of your Store, which contains all of your FGA data and models.

After creating an FGA account, the first step in setting up your access requirements is to build an authorization model. This model defines the application structure for the access relationships. 

In our example, we’ll build a model for granting owner access privileges to a shared document for our user, `john`.

1. Click **Navigate to Model Explorer** to Define your Authorization Model.
2. In the **Model Explorer** page, input the following code snippet:

    ```plaintext
    model  
      schema 1.1
    
    type user
    
    type document
      relations
        define owner: [user]
        define viewer: [user] or owner
        define can_share: owner
    ```

3. Click **Save**.

After saving the authorization model, the Previewer updates with a visualization of the new authorization model and provides a new **Model ID** corresponding to the latest model.

The authorization model that we’ve built now uses modeling `schema 1.1` to declare a `user`, and defines relations that a given `user` has the ability to be assigned owner and viewer permissions, as well as the ability to share our document. 

To apply this model, you can now add a Tuple to create the relationship between the user and the document.

## Add Tuples

Now that we’ve defined our authorization model, we need to assign a user and permission level for access to our document. To do this, we’ll create a **Tuple**. A tuple represents a relationship between a user and an object and is used to store your application's authorization data.

1. Navigate to **Tuple Management** in the left-hand navigation to open the Tuple Management dashboard.
2. Click **+Add Tuple** to add new relationship tuples.
3. In the **user** text box, type in the user identifier. For this guide, input `user:john`.
4. In the **object** line, select the object for which you want to grant `user:john's` access level. Select `document`, and give it a unique identifier. For this example, use `1`.
5. In the **relation** drop-down selector, choose `owner`.
6. Click **Add Tuple** to save your changes.

Your Tuple is now available in your Store. You can edit or delete your Tuple at any time, using the **edit** or **trash** icon.

Now, we’ve created an authorization model that defines our document and possible access levels associated with it. Next, we created a Tuple that declares our user, **john**, should be granted **owner** privileges to our **document**.

## Verify your model

After creating an authorization model and an associated Tuple to define your access relationships, you can verify your model using an assertion.

As mentioned earlier, we’ve defined that john should have owner access to our document. Let’s test our model using an assertion.

>**Note**: You must have a Tuple in your Store before adding an Assertion.


### Add Assertion

The Developer Mode page provides a single-page view with panels to manage your authorization model, relationship tuples, and assertions. 

>**Note**:  If this is your first time visiting this screen, you are prompted with the Guided Tour. Feel free to walk through the demo or bypass and come back later. You can always access the guided tour by clicking the **Guided Tour** button at the top of each navigation section.

1. Navigate to **Developer Mode** in the left-hand navigation to view your current authorization model, tuples, and assertions.
2. Click **+Add Assertion**.
3. Fill in the assertion fields with the values we defined earlier:

    - **User**: `john`
    - **Object**: `document:1`
    - **Relation**: `owner`

4. Click **Add Assertion**.
5. Click the **Run** button on your assertion to test the model.

If the test is successful, you should see the **True** response with a green check mark validating your model.

## Create API Client Credentials

To begin calling the API, you will need API Client Credentials.

1. Navigate to **Settings** in the Dashboard’s sidebar menu.
2. If you do not have the client secret, you will be presented with the **Create Client** button. Click **Create Client**.
3. Enter a client name in the provided text box.
4. Select the permission set(s) required for this specific client.
5. Click **Create** when complete.
6. Make sure to copy the **Store ID**, **Client ID**, and **Client Secret** values.

> **Note**: You will not be able to see the client secret again after this step. It will need to be regenerated if it is lost if compromised in any way. 

# Calling the API

Now that you’ve created your client and obtained your client credentials, you can use `curl` to authenticate and make requests in the command line. Copy the following snippet to your favorite text editor and replace the variables with your API keys received in #Create API Client Credentials.

```bash
FGA_API_URL='https://api.us1.fga.dev'  
FGA_API_TOKEN_ISSUER="fga.us.auth0.com"  
FGA_API_AUDIENCE='https://api.us1.fga.dev/'

# Change these variables 
FGA_STORE_ID='YOUR_STORE_ID'  
FGA_CLIENT_ID='YOUR_CLIENT_ID'  
FGA_CLIENT_SECRET='YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET'  
```

Replace the FGA API URL if it is different from https://fga.us.auth0.com. API URLs are unique to the region the store was created in. Don’t forget the / at the end of the audience URL. It is easy to miss. Print or echo the variables in your terminal to confirm they are working before continuing to the next step.

# Run these commands to make sure the variables saved properly

```bash
echo $FGA_API_URL  
echo $FGA_API_TOKEN_ISSUER  
echo $FGA_API_AUDIENCE  
echo $FGA_STORE_ID  
echo $FGA_CLIENT_ID  
echo $FGA_CLIENT_SECRET  
```

Authenticate You can use your client ID and client secret to get an access token, which can then be used for authorized API calls.

To obtain a token using OAuth 2.0, you can send a POST request to the FGA token issuer endpoint with your client ID and client secret using curl.

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url https://$FGA_API_TOKEN_ISSUER/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
"client_id": "'$FGA_CLIENT_ID'",
"client_secret": "'$FGA_CLIENT_SECRET'",
"audience": "'$FGA_API_AUDIENCE'",
"grant_type":"client_credentials"
    }'
```

# OPTIONAL if you have jq installed

```bash
FGA_API_TOKEN=$(curl --request POST \
  --url https://$FGA_API_TOKEN_ISSUER/oauth/token \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "client_id": "'$FGA_CLIENT_ID'",
    "client_secret": "'$FGA_CLIENT_SECRET'",
    "audience": "'$FGA_API_AUDIENCE'",
    "grant_type":"client_credentials"
}' | jq -r '.access_token')
```

Replace CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET with your actual credentials.

If successful, this command will return a JSON response containing your access token.

```json
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIs.Ino4TzF1WEp.UMkZ5UHRqZ3RmZDZoMiJ9",
  "scope": "check:tuples expand:tuples list:objects list:users read:assertions read:authorization_models read:changes read:tuples write:assertions write:authorization_models write:tuples",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Save the token using the command below and replace `YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN` with the `access_token` from the response above. It will be used in the following commands.

```bash
FGA_API_TOKEN="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

Run this command to make sure it saved the access token properly. If successful, your system should return the access token you received above.

```bash
echo $FGA_API_TOKEN
```


## Make an API Request

Once you have your access token, you can make requests to the API by including the token in the `Authorization` header of your request to FGA.

### Make an Authorization Check

For example, use `curl` to check if John can share the document:

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url $FGA_API_URL/stores/$FGA_STORE_ID/check \
  --header "authorization: Bearer $FGA_API_TOKEN" \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "tuple_key": {
      "user": "user:john",
      "relation": "can_share",
      "object": "document:1"
    }
  }'
```

Response:

```bash
{
  "allowed": true,
  "resolution": ""
}

```


### Write A Tuple 

If John can share the document, then we can now share the document with the external user Anne by writing a tuple to FGA assigning Anne as a viewer on `document:1`.

Set Anne as a viewer of document:1

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url $FGA_API_URL/stores/$FGA_STORE_ID/write \
  --header "authorization: Bearer $FGA_API_TOKEN" \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "writes": {
      "tuple_keys": [
        {
          "user": "user:anne",
          "relation": "viewer",
          "object": "document:1"
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

Response
```json
{}
```
*A blank response is good. It means the Write succeeded without any errors.

To verify that your Tuple was created correctly, 

1. Navigate back to the FGA Dashboard > Tuple Management. 
2. Refresh the page.

Your Tuple should appear as written.

### Verify that sharing the document worked 

Let’s make two more important Checks. 

1. Check that Anne can now view the document:1 
2. Check that Anne cannot share the document (since she only has the viewer relationship)

Can Anne view document:1?

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url $FGA_API_URL/stores/$FGA_STORE_ID/check \
  --header "authorization: Bearer $FGA_API_TOKEN" \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
      "tuple_key": 
  {
    "user": "user:anne",
    	    "relation": "viewer",
    "object": "document:1"
  }
    }'
```

Response
```json
{
  "allowed": true,
  "resolution": ""
}
```

Can Anne share document:1?

```bash
curl --request POST \
  --url $FGA_API_URL/stores/$FGA_STORE_ID/check \
  --header "authorization: Bearer $FGA_API_TOKEN" \
  --header 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
      "tuple_key": 
  {
    "user": "user:anne",
    	    "relation": "can_share",
    "object": "document:1"
  }
    }'
```

Response
```json
{
  "allowed": false,
  "resolution": ""
}
```

This is exactly what we wanted! Congratulations!
