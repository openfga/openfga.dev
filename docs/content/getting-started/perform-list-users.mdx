# Perform a List Users call

:::caution Warning
List Users is currently an experimental feature and not yet suitable for production. There are [known limitations](#known-limitations) to be aware of. Read [the announcement](https://openfga.dev/blog/list-users-announcement) for more information.

<DocumentationNotice />

This section will illustrate how to perform a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-list-users-request" linkName="list users" /> request to determine all the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="users" /> of a given <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="type" /> that have a specified <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship" linkName="relationship" /> with a given <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="object" />.

## Step By Step

Assume that you want to list all users of type `user` that have a `reader` relationship with `document:planning`:

### 01. Configure the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> API Client

Before calling the List Users API, you will need to configure the API client.

<Tabs groupId="languages">
<TabItem value={SupportedLanguage.JS_SDK} label={languageLabelMap.get(SupportedLanguage.JS_SDK)}>

<SdkSetupHeader lang={SupportedLanguage.JS_SDK} />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value={SupportedLanguage.GO_SDK} label={languageLabelMap.get(SupportedLanguage.GO_SDK)}>

<SdkSetupHeader lang={SupportedLanguage.GO_SDK} />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value={SupportedLanguage.DOTNET_SDK} label={languageLabelMap.get(SupportedLanguage.DOTNET_SDK)}>

<SdkSetupHeader lang={SupportedLanguage.DOTNET_SDK} />

</TabItem>
{/* <TabItem value={SupportedLanguage.PYTHON_SDK} label={languageLabelMap.get(SupportedLanguage.PYTHON_SDK)}>

<SdkSetupHeader lang={SupportedLanguage.PYTHON_SDK} />

</TabItem> */}
<TabItem value={SupportedLanguage.JAVA_SDK} label={languageLabelMap.get(SupportedLanguage.JAVA_SDK)}>

<SdkSetupHeader lang={SupportedLanguage.JAVA_SDK} />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value={SupportedLanguage.CLI} label={languageLabelMap.get(SupportedLanguage.CLI)}>

<SdkSetupHeader lang={SupportedLanguage.CLI} />

</TabItem>
<TabItem value={SupportedLanguage.CURL} label={languageLabelMap.get(SupportedLanguage.CURL)}>

To obtain the [access token](https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/call-your-api-using-the-client-credentials-flow):

<SdkSetupHeader lang={SupportedLanguage.CURL} />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 02. Calling List Users API

To return all users of type `user` that have have the `reader` relationship with `document:planning`:

<ListUsersRequestViewer
  authorizationModelId="01HVMMBCMGZNT3SED4Z17ECXCA"
  objectType="document"
  objectId="planning"
  relation="reader"
  userFilterType="user"
  expectedResults={{
    users: [{ object: { type: "user", id: "anne" } }, { object: { type: "user", id: "beth" } }],
    excluded_users: []
  }}
  skipSetup={true}
  allowedLanguages={[
    SupportedLanguage.JS_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.GO_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.DOTNET_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.JAVA_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.CLI,
    SupportedLanguage.CURL,
  ]}
/>

The result `user:anne` and `user:beth` are the `user` objects that have the `reader` relationship with `document:planning`.

:::caution Warning
The performance characteristics of the List Users endpoint vary drastically depending on the model complexity, number of tuples, and the relations it needs to evaluate. Relations with 'and' or 'but not' are particularly expensive to evaluate.
:::

## Usersets

In the above example, only specific subjects of the `user` type were returned. However, groups of users, known as [usersets](../modeling/building-blocks/usersets.mdx), can also be returned from the List Users API. This is done by specifying a `relation` field in the `user_filters` request object. Usersets will only expand to the underlying subjects if that `type` is specified as the user filter object.

Below is an example where usersets can be returned:

```dsl.openfga
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type group
  relations
    define member: [ user ]

type document
  relations
    define viewer: [ group#member ] 
```

With the tuples:

| user | relation| object|
|------|---------|-------|
| group:engineering#member | viewer | document:1|
| group:product#member | viewer | document:1|
| user:will | member | group:engineering#member|

Then calling the List Users API for `document:1` with relation `viewer` of type `group#member` will yield the below response. Note that the `user:will` is not returned, despite being a member of `group:engineering#member` because the `user_filters` does not target the `user` type.

<ListUsersRequestViewer
  authorizationModelId="01HXHK5D1Z6SCG1SV7M3BVZVCV"
  objectType="document"
  objectId="1"
  relation="viewer"
  userFilterType="group"
  userFilterRelation="member"
  expectedResults={{
    users: [{
      userset: {
        id:"engineering",
        relation:"member",
        type:"group"
      }
    },
    {
      userset: {
        id:"product",
        relation:"member",
        type:"group"
      }
    }],
    excluded_users: []
  }}
  skipSetup={true}
  allowedLanguages={[
    SupportedLanguage.JS_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.GO_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.DOTNET_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.JAVA_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.CLI,
    SupportedLanguage.CURL,
  ]}
/>


## Type-bound Public Access

The List Users API supports tuples expressing public access via the wildcard syntax (e.g. `user:*`). Wildcard tuples that satisfy the query criteria will be returned with the `wildcard` root object property that will specify the type. The API will not expand wildcard results further to any ID'd subjects. Further, specific users that have been granted accesss will be returned in addition to any public acccess for that user's type.

Example response with type-bound public access:

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "wildcard": {
        "type":"user"
      }
    },
    {
      "object": {
        "type":"user",
        "id":"anne"
      }
    }
  ],
  "excluded_users":[]
}

```

## Excluded Users

In certain cases, it is important to communicate that certain users are excluded from returned usersets and do not have a relation to the target obect. Most notably, this occurs in models with type-bound public access via wildcard syntax (e.g. `user:*`) and negation via the `but not` syntax. 

Below is an example where excluded users are returned:

```dsl.openfga
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type document
  relations
    define viewer: [user:*] but not blocked
    define blocked: [user]
```

With the tuples:

| user | relation| object|
|------|---------|-------|
| user:* | viewer| document:1|
| user:anne | blocked| document:1|

Calling the List Users API for `document:1` with relation `viewer` of type `user` will yield the response below. It indicates that any object of type `user` (including those not already in OpenFGA as parts of tuples) has access to the system, except for a `user` with id `anne`.

```json
{
  "users": [
    { "wildcard": { "type": "user" } }
  ],
  "excluded_users": [
    { "object": { "type": "user", "id": "anne" } }
  ]
}
```

## Known Limitations

The List Users API is currently available in an experimental capacity and is not yet suitable for production. There are known limitations to note below.

### Exclusion of Nested Usersets

Usersets that are nested within other usersets inherit access their parents' resources by virtue of their nesting. However, child usersets that are negated via the `but not` syntax to either the parent userset or the target document will _not_ be included in the `excluded_users` portion of the payload. 

Example:

```dsl.openfga
model
  schema 1.1

type user

type group
  relations
    define member: [group#member, user] but not blocked
    define blocked: [group#member, user]

type document
  relations
    define viewer: [group#member]
```

With the tuples:

| user | relation| object|
|------|---------|-------|
| group:A#member | viewer| document:1|
| group:B#member | member| group:A|
| group:B#member | blocked| group:A|

<br/>

Then calling the List Users API for `document:1` with relation `viewer` of type `group#member` will yield the response below. Note that `group:B#member` is omitted from `excluded_users`. This omission is problematic for authorization decisions because the response could be interpreted that `group:B#member` has access by virtue of `group:A#member`. 

```json
{
  "users": [
    {
      "userset": {
        "id":"A",
        "relation":"member",
        "type":"group"
      }
    }
  ],
  "excluded_users": [] // `excluded_users` should have `group:B#member`
}
```
