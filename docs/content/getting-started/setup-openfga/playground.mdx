# Using the OpenFGA Playground 

The Playground facilitates rapid development by allowing you to visualize and model your application's authorization models and manage relationship tuples with a locally running OpenFGA instance.

It is enabled on port 3000 by default and accessible at http://localhost:3000/playground. 

The Playground is designed for early prototyping and learning. It has serveral limitations:

- It works by embedding the public [Playground website](https://play.fga.dev) in an `<iframe>`. To do this securely, the public Playground configures its Content Security Policies to enable running it from `localhost`. **You can't run the Playground in a host different than `localhost`.
- It does not support OIDC authentication. 
- It's loads up to 100 tuples.
- It does not support conditional tuples or contextual tuples.

We have [the intention](https://github.com/openfga/roadmap/issues/7) to rewrite the Playground code and open source it, which will make it possible to overcome some of those limitations. 

However, we recommend that for managing a production OpenFGA deployment, you use the [Visual Studio Code integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openfga.openfga-vscode), [OpenFGA CLI](https://github.com/openfga/cli), combined with the ability to specify a model + tuples + assertions in [.fga.yaml](https://github.com/openfga/cli#run-tests-on-an-authorization-model) files.

## Running the Playground in a different port

You can change the playground port using the `--playground-port` flag. For example,

```sh
openfga run --playground-enabled --playground-port 3001
```

## Disabling the Playground

As the Playground allows performing any action in the OpenFGA server, it's not recommended to have it enabled in production deployments.

To run OpenFGA with the Playground disabled, provide the `--playground-enabled=false` flag.

```shell
openfga run --playground-enabled=false
```
