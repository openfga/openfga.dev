# Setup OpenFGA Server

<DocumentationNotice />

This article explains how to start your own OpenFGA server using Docker, and how to configure it.

## Step By Step

If you want to run OpenFGA locally as a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).
2. Run `docker run -p 127.0.0.1:8080:8080 -p 127.0.0.1:8081:8081 openfga/openfga`.

This will start an HTTP server and gRPC server with the default configuration options.

## Configuring The Server

There are several configuration options for OpenFGA. One option is to pass them in with an environment file. For example:

```
$ cat ./myenv
OPENFGA_DATASTORE_ENGINE=postgres
OPENFGA_AUTH_PRESHARED_KEYS=key1,key2
# etc

$ docker run openfga/openfga --env-file ./myenv
```

All the possible configuration options are:

### Configuring Data Storage

You can choose between two storage options:

- In-memory storage. This option is not persistent, i.e. if you restart the server, the data will be lost.
- Postgres database. This option requires either a local Postgres installation, or a Docker container that runs Postgres. For an example of a Docker setup that includes a Postgres database, see [OpenFGA's Docker compose file](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/main/docker-compose.yaml).

### Configuring Authentication

You can configure authentication in your OpenFGA server in two ways: no authentication (the default) or pre-shared key authentication.

If using **Pre-shared key authentication**, you will configure OpenFGA with a secret key and your application calling OpenFGA will have to set an `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-KEY-HERE>` header. You can configure multiple keys.

:::caution Warning
If you are going to use this setup in production, you should enable TLS in your OpenFGA server.
:::

## Production Recommendations

If you have tried OpenFGA locally, decided it works as expected, and now want to deploy it to production, we recommend the following preparation:

- Update the configuration as follows:
  - Configure authentication on the server as explained above.
  - Enable TLS on the server.
  - Enable production logging by changing the `OPENFGA_DEVELOPMENT_LOGGING` environment variable to `false`.
- Consider forking the repository and
  - Adding a rate limiter interceptor that protects your OpenFGA server against bursts in traffic.
  - Adding a logger interceptor that sends logging to your logging platform of choice.
