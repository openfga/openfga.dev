# Setup OpenFGA Server

<DocumentationNotice />

This article explains how to start your own OpenFGA server using Docker, and how to configure it.

## Step By Step

If you want to run OpenFGA locally as a Docker container, follow these steps:

1. [Install Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (if not already installed).
2. Run `docker pull openfga/openfga` to get the latest docker image.
3. Run `docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 3000:3000 openfga/openfga run`.

This will start an HTTP server and gRPC server with the default configuration options. Port 8080 is used to serve the HTTP API, 8081 is used to serve the gRPC API, and 3000 is used for the [Playground](#playground).

## Configuring The Server

You may configure the OpenFGA server with a `config.yaml` file. The `config.yaml` can be specified in either:
- `/etc/openfga`
- `$HOME/.openfga`
- `.` (i.e., the current working directory).

The OpenFGA will server search for the configuration file in the above order.

Here is a sample configuration to run OpenFGA with postgres and using a preshared key for authentication:

```yaml
datastore:
  engine: postgres
  uri: postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/mydatabase
authn:
  method: preshared
  preshared:
    keys: ["key1", "key2"]
```

All possible configurations and their default values are defined in [config-schema.json](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/blob/main/.config-schema.json).

:::info Information
The OpenFGA server supports **environment variables** for configuration, it will take priority against your configuration file. 
Each variable must be prefixed with `OPENFGA_` and followed by your option in uppercase (e.g `--grpc-tls-key` becomes `OPENFGA_GRPC_TLS_KEY`).
:::

### Configuring Data Storage

OpenFGA supports multiple storage engine options including:

- `memory` - The memory storage engine is the default, but it is not persistent (data is lost between server restarts).
- `postgres` - The Postgres storage engine requires a Postgres instance that the OpenFGA server can reach.
- `mysql` - The MySQL storage engine requires a MySQL instance that the OpenFGA server can reach, and that the connection uri specifies the query `parseTime=true`.

#### Postgres

<Tabs groupId={"installation"}>
<TabItem value={"docker"} label={"Docker"}>

Let's assume you want to run OpenFGA and Postgres in containers. The first thing we should do is create a new network as this will make communication between containers a bit simpler:

```shell
docker network create openfga
```

Start Postgres in the network you created above:

```shell
docker run -d --name postgres --network=openfga -e POSTGRES_USER=postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password postgres:14
```

You should now have Postgres running in a container in the `openfga` network. However, it will not have the tables required for running OpenFGA. You can use the `migrate` command to create the tables. Using the OpenFGA container, this will look like:

```shell
docker run --rm --network=openfga openfga/openfga migrate \
    --datastore-engine postgres \
    --datastore-uri 'postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable'
```

Finally, start OpenFGA:

```shell
docker run --name openfga --network=openfga -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 openfga/openfga run \
    --datastore-engine postgres \
    --datastore-uri 'postgres://postgres:password@postgres:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable'
```
</TabItem>
<TabItem value={"docker-compose"} label={"Docker Compose"}>

Copy the below code block into a local file named: `docker-compose.yaml`

```yaml
version: '3.8'

networks:
  openfga:

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:14
    networks:
      - openfga
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=postgres
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password
      - POSTGRES_DB=openfga
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres" ]
      interval: 5s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  pause:
    image: ubuntu
    command: sleep 5
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_started

  migrate:
    image: openfga/openfga
    depends_on:
      pause:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
    command: |
      migrate
    environment: 
      - OPENFGA_DATASTORE_ENGINE=postgres
      - OPENFGA_DATASTORE_URI=postgres://postgres:password@db:5432/openfga
    networks:
      - openfga

  openfga:
    image: openfga/openfga
    environment:
      - OPENFGA_DATASTORE_ENGINE=postgres
      - OPENFGA_DATASTORE_URI=postgres://postgres:password@db:5432/openfga
      - OPENFGA_LOG_FORMAT=json
    command: run
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_started
      migrate:
        condition: service_completed_successfully
    networks:
      - openfga
    ports:
      # Needed for the http server
      - "8080:8080"
      # Needed for the grpc server (if used)
      - "8081:8081"
      # Needed for the playground (Do not enable in prod!)
      - "3000:3000"
```

In a terminal, navigate to that directory and run:
```shell
docker-compose up
```
</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will start the postgres database, run `openfga migrate` to configure the database and finally start the OpenFGA server.
OpenFGA should start and you should see `using 'postgres' storage engine` in the logs.

Now you can try to [Create a Store](./create-store.mdx).

#### MySQL

Setting up MySQL and OpenFGA is very similar to setting up Postgres and OpenFGA. 
We first make a network:
```shell
docker network create openfga
```

Then, start MySQL in the network you created above:

```shell
docker run -d --name mysql --network=openfga -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret -e MYSQL_DATABASE=openfga mysql:8
```

You should now have MySQL running in a container in the `openfga` network. But we still have to migrate all the tables to be able to run OpenFGA. You can use the `migrate` command to create the tables. Using the OpenFGA container, this will look like:

```shell
docker run --rm --network=openfga openfga/openfga migrate \
    --datastore-engine mysql \
    --datastore-uri 'root:secret@tcp(mysql:3306)/openfga?parseTime=true'
```

Finally, start OpenFGA:

```shell
docker run --name openfga --network=openfga -p 3000:3000 -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 openfga/openfga run \
    --datastore-engine mysql \
    --datastore-uri 'root:secret@tcp(mysql:3306)/openfga?parseTime=true'
```


OpenFGA should start and you should see `using 'mysql' storage engine` in the logs.

Now you can try to [Create a Store](./create-store.mdx).

##### MySQL Limitations
Note that the MySQL datastore has stricter limits for the max length of some fields for tuples compared to other datastore engines, in particular:
- object type is at most 128 characters (down from 256)
- object id is at most 128 characters (down from 256)
- user is at most 256 characters (down from 512)

### Configuring Authentication

You can configure authentication in your OpenFGA server in two ways: no authentication (the default) or pre-shared key authentication.

If using **Pre-shared key authentication**, you will configure OpenFGA with a secret key and your application calling OpenFGA will have to set an `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR-KEY-HERE>` header. You can configure multiple keys.

:::caution Warning
If you are going to use this setup in production, you should enable TLS in your OpenFGA server.
:::

### Playground

The Playground facilitates rapid development by allowing you to visualize and model your application's authorization model(s) and manage relationship tuples with a locally running OpenFGA instance.

The Playground is enabled on port 3000 by default and accessible at http://localhost:3000/playground (if using the docker make sure port 3000 is exposed to your local network). To disable the Playground, please take a look at [Configuring the Server](#configuring-the-server) for more information.

### Profiler (pprof)
:::caution Warning
Continuous pprof profiling can be used in production deployments, but we recommend disabling it unless it is needed to troubleshoot specific performance or memory problems.
:::

Profiling through pprof can be enabled on the OpenFGA server by providing the `--profiler-enabled` flag.

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 openfga/openfga run --profiler-enabled
```

:::note
Remember to expose the profiler port if you're running OpenFGA via docker. For example `docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 3000:3000 -p 3001:3001 openfga/openfga run --profiler-enabled`.
:::

If you need to serve the profiler on a different address than the default `:3001`, you can do so by specifying the `--profiler-addr` flag. For example,

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 3000:3000 -p 3002:3002 openfga/openfga run --profiler-enabled --profiler-addr :3002
```

## Health Check

OpenFGA is configured with an HTTP health check endpoint `/healthz` and a gRPC health check `grpc.health.v1.Health/Check`, which is wired to datastore testing. Possible response values are
- UNKNOWN
- SERVING
- NOT_SERVING
- SERVICE_UNKNOWN

For HTTP health check

```console
curl -X GET $FGA_API_HOST/healthz

# {"status":"SERVING"}
```

For gRPC health check

```console
grpcurl -plaintext $FGA_API_HOST grpc.health.v1.Health/Check

# {"status":"SERVING"}
```

## Experimental Features
Various releases of OpenFGA may have experimental features that can be enabled by providing the `--experimentals` flag or the `experimentals` config.

```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 openfga/openfga run --experimentals="feature1, feature2"
```
or if you're using environment variables,
```
docker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 openfga/openfga -e OPENFGA_EXPERIMENTALS="feature1, feature2" run
```

The following table table enumerates the experimental flags, a description of what they do, and the versions of OpenFGA the flag is supported in:

| name                   | description                                                                                              | openfga version |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| list-objects-optimized | Enables support for an optimized version of the [openfga.v1.ListObjects](/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects) API for models with schema version 1.1 | >= v0.3.1       |
| otel-metrics           | Enables support for exposing OpenFGA metrics through OpenTelemetry | >= v0.3.2       |

:::caution Warning
Experimental features are not guaranteed to be stable and may lead to server instabilities. It is not recommended to enable experimental features for anything other than experimentation.

Experimental feature flags are also not considered part of API compatibility and are subject to change, so please refer to each OpenFGA specific release for a list of the experimental feature flags that can be enabled for that release.
:::

## Telemetry (Metrics and Tracing)


### Metrics
To expose OpenFGA metrics you must enable the `otel-metrics` experimental feature (see [Experimental Features](#experimental-features)).

:::info
OpenTelemetry metrics are exported in [`otlp`](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-specification/blob/main/specification/protocol/otlp.md) format.

Other export formats may be supported in the future, but in the meantime you can setup an OpenTelemetry Collector to receive, process, and publish metrics in other formats. For more information see the [official OpenTelemetry Collector documentation](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/).
:::

If you need to configure the OpenTelemetry integration with non-default values you can supply the `--otel-telemetry-endpoint` and `--otel-telemetry-protocol` flags. These flags wire up the OpenTelemetry exporter with the provided collector endpoint and configures the exporter protocol (`grpc` or `http`). For more information see [OTLP gRPC Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/otlpexporter/README.md) and [OTLP HTTP Exporter](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/otlphttpexporter/README.md). For example,
```
openfga run --experimentals=otel-metrics --otel-telemetry-endpoint=127.0.0.1:4317 --otel-telemetry-protocol=http
```

### Tracing
OpenFGA, when run in standalone server mode, does not yet support tracing. This work is in our roadmap and we will update this section with more information when the time comes.
