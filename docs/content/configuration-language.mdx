# Configuration Language

<DocumentationNotice />

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/>'s Configuration Language is used to build a representation of a system's _<ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" />_. It informs <UpdateProductNameInLinks link="/api/service" name="{ProductName}'s API" /> on what the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="object types" /> in the system are and how they could relate to one another. It describes the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="relations" /> possible on an object of a certain type and lists the conditions under which one is related to that object.

The **DSL** and the **JSON** syntax are two presentations of that configuration language. The JSON syntax is accepted by the API and closely matches the API described in the [Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). The DSL is syntactic sugar on top of the JSON syntax and compiles down to it before being sent to <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>'s API. The DSL is meant to make modeling easier and more intuitive.

You'll encounter the JSON syntax when calling the API directly or through the [SDKs](./getting-started), and the DSL when interacting with <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> through the [Playground](https://play.fga.dev/). Throughout the documentation you can switch between the two presentations.

To understand this guide better, you should be familiar with some <ProductConcept /> and [How to get started on modeling](./modeling/getting-started.mdx).

## What Does The Configuration Language Look Like?

Below is a sample authorization model. In the next sections we'll go over the building blocks that make the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> configuration language.

:::info

The _authorization model_ describes four _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="types" />_ of objects: `user`, `domain`, `folder` and `document`.

The `domain` _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type-definition" linkName="type definition" />_ has a single _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="relation" />_ called `member` that only allows <ProductConcept section="what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships" linkName="direct relationships" />.

The `folder` and `document` _type definitions_ each have five _relations_: `parent_folder`, `owner`, `writer`, `viewer` and `can_share`.

:::

### The Direct Relationship Type Restrictions

`[<string, <string>, ...]`, when used at the beginning of a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation-definition" linkName="relation definition" /> allows <ProductConcept section="what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships" linkName="direct relationships" /> from the objects of these specified types. The strings can be of three formats:
- `<type>`: indicating that tuples relating objects of those types as users can be written (e.g. `group:marketing` can be related if `group` is in the type restrictions)
- `<type:*>`: indicating that a tuple relating all objects of that type can be written (e.g. `user:*` can be added if `user:*` is in the type restrictions)
- `<type>#<relation>`: indicating that tuples with sets of users that are related to an object of that type by that particular relation (e.g. `group:marketing#member` can be added if `group#member` is in the type restrictions)

If the direct relationship type restrictions are missing, then no tuple can be written relating other objects as this particular relation with objects of this type (direct relationships are disallowed).

:::info

`[<type1>, <type2>, ...]` in the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> DSL translates to `this` in the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> API syntax.

:::

For example, let's take a closer look at the `team` type.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type: 'team',
    relations: {
      member: {
        this: {},
      },
    },
    metadata: {
      relations: {
        member: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }, { type: 'user:*'}, { type: 'team', relation: 'member' }] },
      },
    },
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

This `team` _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type-definition" linkName="type definition" />_ defines all the _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="relations" />_ that _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="users" />_ can have with an _<ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="object" />_ of _type_ `team`. In this case the _relation_ is: `member`.

Due to the direct relationship type restrictions (`[user, team#member]`) being used, a user in the system can have a **<ProductConcept section="what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships" linkName="direct relationship" />** with the `team` type as a `member` for objects of 
- type `user`
- the `user` <ProductConcept section="what-is-type-bound-public-access" linkName="type bound public access" /> (`user:*`)
- [usersets](./modeling/building-blocks/usersets.mdx) that have a `team` type and a `member` relation (e.g. `team:product#member`)

In the type definition snippet above, `anne` is a `member` of `team:product` if _any one of_ the following relationship tuple sets exist:

- <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'member',
        object: 'team:product',
        _description: 'Anne is directly related to the product team as a member',
      },
    ]}
  />

- <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:*',
        relation: 'member',
        object: 'team:product',
        _description: 'Everyone (`*`) is directly related to the product team as a member',
      },
    ]}
  />

- <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'team:contoso#member',
        relation: 'member',
        object: 'team:product',
        _description: 'Members of the contoso team are members of the product team',
      },
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'member',
        object: 'team:contoso',
        _description: 'Anne is a member of the contoso team',
      },
    ]}
  />

For more examples, take look at [Modeling Building Blocks: Direct Relationships](./modeling/building-blocks/direct-relationships.mdx).

### Referencing Other Relations On The Same Object

You can also reference other relations on the same object. Let us look at a simplified `document` _type definition_.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type: 'document',
    relations: {
      editor: {
        this: {},
      },
      viewer: {
        union: {
          child: [
            { this: {} },
            {
              computedUserset: {
                relation: 'editor',
              },
            },
          ],
        },
      },
      can_rename: {
        computedUserset: {
          relation: 'editor',
        },
      },
    },
    metadata: {
      relations: {
        editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
        viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
      },
    },
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

The above `document` _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type-definition" linkName="type definition" />_ defines all the _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="relations" />_ that _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="users" />_ can have with an _<ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="object" />_ of _type_ `document`. In this case the _relations_ are: `editor`, `viewer` and `can_rename`.

The `viewer` and `can_rename` _relation definitions_ are both referencing `editor`, which is another relation on the same type.

:::info

Notice how `can_rename` does not reference the [_direct relationship type restrictions_](#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions), indicating that a direct relationship is not possible (as in a user cannot be directly assigned this relation, it has to be inherited through an assignment of the `editor` relation). The `viewer` relation on the other hand allows both _direct and indirect relationships_ using the [Union Operator](#the-union-operator).

:::

In the _type definition_ snippet above, `anne` is a `viewer` of `document:new-roadmap` if any one of the following relationship tuple sets exists:

- _anne_ is an _editor_ of _document:new-roadmap_

  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'editor',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        _description: 'Anne is an editor of the new-roadmap document',
      },
    ]}
  />

- _anne_ is a _viewer_ of _document:new-roadmap_
  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'viewer',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        _description: 'Anne is a viewer of the new-roadmap document',
      },
    ]}
  />

`anne` has a `can_rename` relationship with `document:new-roadmap` only if `anne` has an `editor` relationship with the document:

- _anne_ is an _editor_ of _document:new-roadmap_
  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'editor',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        _description: 'Anne is an editor of thew new-roadmap document',
      },
    ]}
  />

### Referencing Relations On Related Objects

Another form of _<ProductConcept section="what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships" linkName="indirect relationships" />_ is made possible by referencing relations on other objects.

The syntax is `X from Y`.
It requires that:

- the other object is related to the current object as `Y`
- the _user_ is related to another object as `X`

Take a look at the _authorization model_ below.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'folder',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }, { type: 'folder', relation: 'viewer' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          parent_folder: {
            this: {},
          },
          viewer: {
            union: {
              child: [
                { this: {} },
                {
                  tupleToUserset: {
                    tupleset: {
                      object: '',
                      relation: 'parent_folder',
                    },
                    computedUserset: {
                      object: '',
                      relation: 'viewer',
                    },
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            parent_folder: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'folder' }] },
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

The snippet below taken from the authorization model above is stating that viewers of a document are all users directly assigned the viewer relation and all users who can view the document's parent folder.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            union: {
              child: [
                { this: {} },
                {
                  tupleToUserset: {
                    tupleset: {
                      object: '',
                      relation: 'parent_folder',
                    },
                    computedUserset: {
                      object: '',
                      relation: 'viewer',
                    },
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

In the _authorization model_ above, `user:anne` is a `viewer` of `document:new-roadmap` if any one of the following relationship tuple sets exists:

- Anne is a viewer of the parent folder of the new-roadmap document
  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'folder:planning',
        relation: 'parent_folder',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        _description: 'planning folder is the parent folder of the new-roadmap document',
      },
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'viewer',
        object: 'folder:planning',
        _description: 'anne is a viewer of the planning folder',
      },
    ]}
  />
- Anne is a viewer of the new-roadmap document (direct relationship)
  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'viewer',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        _description: 'anne is a viewer of the new-roadmap document',
      },
    ]}
  />

This particular use of referencing relations on related objects is defining a transitive implied relationship. If **user A** is related to a certain **object B** as a **viewer**, and **object B** is related to **object C** as **parent**, then **user A** is related to **object C** as **viewer**.

This can be used to indicate that **viewers** of a **folders** are **viewers** of all **documents** in that **folder**.

:::caution
Note that <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> does not allow the referenced relation (the word after `from`, also called the tupleset) to be referencing another relation or allow non-concrete types (type bound public access (`<object_type>:*`) or usersets (`<object_type>#<relation>`)) in its type restrictions and will throw a validation error when attempting to call `WriteAuthorizationModel`.

Note: In the [deprecated 1.0 schema version](./modeling/migrating/migrating-schema-1-1.mdx), the validation error will be thrown at the time of evaluation (`Check`, etc..).

### The Union Operator

The _union operator_ (`or` in the DSL, `union` in the JSON syntax) is used to indicate that a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship" linkName="relationship" /> exists if the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="user" /> is in **any of the sets of users** (`union`).

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            // a user is related to the object as a viewer if:
            union: {
              // they are in any of
              child: [
                {
                  this: {}, // the userset of all users related to the object as "viewer"; indicating that a user can be assigned a direct `viewer` relation, i.e., not implied through another relation
                },
                {
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'editor', // the userset of all users related to the object as "editor"; indicating that a user who is an editor is also implicitly a viewer
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

In the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type-definition" linkName="type definition" /> snippet above, `user:anne` is a `viewer` of `document:new-roadmap` if _any of_ the following conditions are satisfied:

- there exists a <ProductConcept section="what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships" linkName="direct relationship" /> with _anne_ as _editor_ of _document:new-roadmap_
  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'editor',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      },
    ]}
  />
- _anne_ is a _viewer_ of _document:new-roadmap_
  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'viewer',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      },
    ]}
  />

:::info

The above <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" /> indicates that a user is related as a viewer if they are in **any of**:

- the userset of all users related to the object as "viewer"; indicating that a user can be assigned a direct `viewer` relation
- the userset of all users related to the object as "editor"; indicating that a user who is an editor is also implicitly a viewer

So if **anne** is in at least one of those usersets (is either an **editor** or a **viewer**), the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-check-request" linkName="check" /> on `{"user": "user:anne", "relation": "viewer", "object": "document:new-roadmap"}` will return `{"allowed": true}`.

### The Intersection Operator

The _intersection operator_ (`and` in the DSL, `intersection` in the JSON syntax) is used to indicate that a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship" linkName="relationship" /> exists if the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="user" /> is in **all the sets of users** (`intersection`)

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            // a user is related to the object as a viewer if
            intersection: {
              // they are in all of
              child: [
                {
                  computedUserset: {
                    // the userset of all users related to the object as "authorized_user"
                    relation: 'authorized_user',
                  },
                },
                {
                  computedUserset: {
                    // the userset of all users related to the object as "editor"
                    relation: 'editor',
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

In the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type-definition" linkName="type definition" /> snippet above, `user:anne` is a `viewer` of `document:new-roadmap` if **all of** the following conditions are satisfied:

- _anne_ is an _editor_ of _document:new-roadmap_
  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'editor',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      },
    ]}
  />
  AND
- _anne_ is an _authorized_user_ of _document:new-roadmap_:
  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'authorized_user',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      },
    ]}
  />

:::info

The above <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" /> indicates that a user is related as a viewer if they are in **all of**:

- the userset of all users related to the object as "authorized_user"
- the userset of all users related to the object as "editor"

So **anne** has to be in the intersection of the usersets (**anne** has to be both an **editor** AND an **authorized_user**), in order for the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-check-request" linkName="check" /> on `{"user": "user:anne", "relation": "viewer", "object": "document:new-roadmap"}` to return `{"allowed": true}`.

_anne_ is **not** a _viewer_ for _document:new-roadmap_ if either of the following is true:

- _anne_ is not an _editor_ to _document:new-roadmap_: **no relationship tuple of** `{"user": "user:anne", "relation": "editor", "object": "document:new-roadmap"}`
- _anne_ is not an _authorized_user_ on the _document:new-roadmap_: **no relationship tuple of** `{"user": "user:anne", "relation": "authorized_user", "object": "document:new-roadmap"}`

### The Exclusion Operator

The _exclusion operator_ (`but not` in the DSL, `difference` in the JSON syntax) is used to indicate that a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship" linkName="relationship" /> exists if the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="user" /> is **in the base userset, but not in the excluded userset**. This is helpful in modeling exclusion or block lists.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            // a user is related to the object as a viewer if they are in
            difference: {
              base: {
                this: {}, // the userset of all users related to the object as "viewer"
              },
              subtract: {
                computedUserset: {
                  relation: 'blocked', // but not in the userset of all users related to the object as "blocked"
                },
              },
            },
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

In the _type definition_ snippet above, `user:anne` is a `viewer` of `document:new-roadmap` if:

- _anne_ is assigned a direct relationship as _viewer_ to _document:new-roadmap_

  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'viewer',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      },
    ]}
  />
  AND

- _anne_ is not _blocked_ to _document:new-roadmap_. That is, the following relation tuple **does not exists**
  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'blocked',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      },
    ]}
  />

For more information, see [Modeling: Blocklists](./modeling/blocklists.mdx).

:::info

The above <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" /> indicates that a user is related as a viewer if they are in:

- the userset of all users related to the object as "viewer"

but not in:

- the userset of all users related to the object as "blocked"

So **anne** has to be both a **viewer** AND NOT **blocked**, in order for the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-check-request" linkName="check" /> on `{"user": "user:anne", "relation": "viewer", "object": "document:new-roadmap"}` to return `{"allowed": true}`.

_anne_ is **not** a _viewer_ for _document:new-roadmap_ if either of the following is true:

- _anne_ is **not** assigned direct relationship as _viewer_ to _document:new-roadmap_: **no relationship tuple of** `{"user": "user:anne", "relation": "viewer", "object": "document:new-roadmap"}`
- _anne_ is _blocked_ on the _document:new-roadmap_ `{"user": "user:anne", "relation": "blocked", "object": "document:new-roadmap"}`

## Equivalent Zanzibar Concepts

The JSON syntax accepted by the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> API closely mirrors the syntax represented in the Zanzibar paper, with a bit of flattening and converting keys from `snake_case` to `camelCase`.

| Zanzibar           | <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> JSON | <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> DSL |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `this`             | `this`                                                   | [`[<type1>,<type2>]`](#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions)                                                  |
| `union`            | `union`                                                  | `or`                                                    |
| `intersection`     | `intersection`                                           | `and`                                                   |
| `exclusion`        | `difference`                                             | `but not`                                               |
| `tuple_to_userset` | `tupleToUserset`                                         | `x from y`                                              |

In the [Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/), there's this example:

```
name: "doc"

relation { name: "owner" }

relation {
  name: "editor"
  userset_rewrite {
    union {
      child { _this {} }
      child { computed_userset { relation: "owner" } }
}}}

relation {
 name: "viewer"
 userset_rewrite {
  union {
    child { _this {} }
    child { computed_userset { relation: "editor" } }
    child { tuple_to_userset {
      tupleset { relation: "parent" }
      computed_userset {
        object: $TUPLE_USERSET_OBJECT  # parent folder
        relation: "viewer" }}}
}}}
```

In the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> DSL, it would become:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  onlyShow={SyntaxFormat.Friendly2}
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [

                {
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'owner',
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
          viewer: {
            union: {
              child: [
                {
                  this: {},
                },
                {
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'editor',
                  },
                },
                {
                  tupleToUserset: {
                    tupleset: {
                      relation: 'parent',
                    },

                  },

        },
      },
    ],
  }}

We believe this syntax is easier to read/write.

So the following:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'doc',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            union: {
              child: [
                {
                  // a user can be assigned a direct `viewer` relation, i.e., not implied through another relation
                  this: {},
                },
                {
                  // a user that is an editor is also implicitly a viewer
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'editor',
                  },
                },
                {
                  // a user that is an viewer on any of the object's parents is also implicitly a viewer on the object
                  tupleToUserset: {
                    tupleset: {
                      relation: 'parent',
                    },
                    computedUserset: {
                      relation: 'viewer',
                    },
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

Can be read as:

- The users with a viewer relationship to a certain doc are any of:
  - the set of users who are <ProductConcept section="what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships" linkName="directly related" /> with this doc as `viewer`
  - the set of users who are related to this doc as `editor`
  - the set of users who are related to any object OBJ_1 as `viewer`, where object OBJ_1 is any object related to this doc as `parent` (e.g. viewers of this doc's parent folder, where the parent folder is OBJ_1)
