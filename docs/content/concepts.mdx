# Concepts

<DocumentationNotice />

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ProductLink}/> service answers <IntroductionSection linkName="authorization" section="authentication-vs-authorization"/> [checks](#what-is-a-check-request) by determining whether a **[relationship](#what-is-a-relation)** exists between an [object](#what-is-an-object) and a [user](#what-is-a-user). Checks reference your **[authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model)** against your **[relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple)** for authorization authority. Below are explanations of basic FGA concepts, like type and authorization model, and a [playground](https://play.fga.dev/) to test your knowledge.

<Playground />

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Type?

A **type** is a string. It defines a class of objects with similar characteristics.

</summary>

The following are examples of types:

- `workspace`
- `repository`
- `organization`
- `document`

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Type Definition?

A **type definition** defines all possible relations a user or another object can have in relation to this type.

</summary>

Below is an example of a type definition:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type: 'document',
    relations: {
      viewer: {
        this: {},
      },
      commenter: {
        this: {},
      },
      editor: {
        this: {},
      },
      owner: {
        this: {},
      },
    },
    metadata: {
      relations: {
        viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
        commenter: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
        editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
        owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
      },
    },
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is An Authorization Model?

An **authorization model** combines one or more type definitions. This is used to define the permission model of a system.

</summary>

Below is an example of an authorization model:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
          commenter: {
            this: {},
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
          owner: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'domain', relation: 'member' }, { type: 'user' }] },
            commenter: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'domain', relation: 'member' }, { type: 'user' }] },
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'domain', relation: 'member' }, { type: 'user' }] },
            owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'domain', relation: 'member' }, { type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'domain',
        relations: {
          member: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            member: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

Together with [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple), the authorization model determines whether a [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) exists between a [user](#what-is-a-user) and an [object](#what-is-an-object).

<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> uses two different syntaxes to define the authorization model:

- A JSON syntax accepted by the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> API that closely follows the original syntax in the [Zanzibar Paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). For more information, see [Equivalent Zanzibar Concepts](./modeling-language.mdx#equivalent-zanzibar-concepts).
- A simpler-to-use DSL that's accepted by both the [OpenFGA VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openfga.openfga-vscode) and [OpenFGA CLI](https://github.com/openfga/cli/) and offers syntax highlighting and validation in the VS Code extension. The DSL is used in the [Sample Stores](https://github.com/openfga/sample-stores) modeling examples and is translated to API-supported syntax using the CLI or [OpenFGA language](https://github.com/openfga/language) before being sent to the API.

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Store?

A **store** is an <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> entity used to organize authorization check data.

</summary>

Each store contains one or more versions of an [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model) and can contain various [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple). Store data cannot be shared across stores; we recommended storing all data that may be related or affect your authorization result in a single store.

Separate stores can be created for separate authorization needs or isolated environments, e.g. development/prod.

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is An Object?

An **object** represents an entity in the system. Users' relationships to it are defined by relationship tuples and the authorization model.

</summary>

An object is a combination of a [type](#what-is-a-type) and an identifier.

For example:

- `workspace:fb83c013-3060-41f4-9590-d3233a67938f`
- `repository:auth0/express-jwt`
- `organization:org_ajUc9kJ`
- `document:new-roadmap`

[User](#what-is-a-user), [relation](#what-is-a-relation) and object are the building blocks for [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

For an example, see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A User?

A **user** is an entity in the system that can be related to an object.

</summary>

A user is is a combination of a [type](#what-is-a-type), an identifier, and an optional relation.

For example,

- any identifier: e.g. `user:anne` or `user:4179af14-f0c0-4930-88fd-5570c7bf6f59`
- any object: e.g. `workspace:fb83c013-3060-41f4-9590-d3233a67938f`, `repository:auth0/express-jwt` or `organization:org_ajUc9kJ`
- a group or a set of users (also called a **userset**): e.g. `organization:org_ajUc9kJ#members`, which represents the set of users related to the object `organization:org_ajUc9kJ` as `member`
- everyone, using the special syntax: `*`

User, [relation](#what-is-a-relation) and [object](#what-is-an-object) are the building blocks for [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

For more information, see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relation?

A **relation** is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model. Relations define a possible relationship between an object (of the same type as the type definition) and a user in the system.

</summary>

Examples of relation:

- User can be a `reader` of a document
- Team can `administer` a repo
- User can be a `member` of a team

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relation Definition?

A **relation definition** lists the conditions or requirements under which a relationship is possible.

</summary>

For example:

- `editor` describing a possible relationship between a user and an object in the `document` type allows the following:
  - **user identifier to object relationship**: the user id `anne` of type `user` is related to the object `document:roadmap` as `editor`
  - **object to object relationship**: the object `application:ifft` is related to the object `document:roadmap` as `editor`
  - **userset to object relationship**: the userset `organization:auth0.com#member` is related to `document:roadmap` as `editor`
    - indicates that the set of users who are related to the object `organization:auth0.com` as `member` are related to the object `document:roadmap` as `editor`s
    - allows for potential solutions to use-cases like sharing a document internally with all members of a company or a team
  - **everyone to object relationship**: everyone (`*`) is related to `document:roadmap` as `editor`
    - this is how one could model publicly editable documents

These would be defined in the [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model):

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
          commenter: {
            this: {},
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
          owner: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            commenter: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
    ],
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

:::info

There are four relations in the document type configuration: `viewer`, `commenter`, `editor` and `owner`.

:::

[User](#what-is-a-user), relation and [object](#what-is-an-object) are the building blocks for [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

For an example, see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Directly Related User Type?

A **directly related user type** is an array specified in the type definition to indicate which types of users can be directly related to that relation.

</summary>

For the following model, only [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple) with [user](#what-is-a-user) of [type](#what-is-a-type) `user` may be assigned to document.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

A relationship tuple with user `user:anne` or `user:3f7768e0-4fa7-4e93-8417-4da68ce1846c` may be written for objects with type `document` and relation `viewer`, so writing `{"user": "user:anne","relation":"viewer","object":"document:roadmap"}` succeeds.
A relationship tuple with a disallowed user type for the `viewer` relation on objects of type `document` - for example `workspace:auth0` or `folder:planning#editor` - will be rejected, so writing `{"user": "folder:product","relation":"viewer","object":"document:roadmap"}` will fail.
This affects only relations that are [directly related](#what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships) and have [direct relationship type restrictions](./modeling-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions) in their relation definition.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
## What is a Condition?

A **condition** is a function composed of one or more parameters and an expression. Every condition evaluates to a boolean outcome, and expressions are defined using [Google's Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec).
</summary>

In the following snippet `less_than_hundred` defines a Condition that evaluates to a boolean outcome. The provided parameter `x`, defined as an integer type, is used in the boolean expression `x < 100`. The condition returns a truthy outcome if the expression returns a truthy outcome, but is otherwise false.
```
condition less_than_hundred(x: int) {
  x < 100
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relationship Tuple?

A **relationship tuple** is a base tuple/triplet consisting of a user, relation, and object. Tuples may add an optional condition, like [Conditional Relationship Tuples](#what-is-a-conditional-relationship-tuple). Relationship tuples are written and stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>.

</summary>

A relationship tuple consists of:

- a **[user](#what-is-a-user)**, e.g. `user:anne`, `user:3f7768e0-4fa7-4e93-8417-4da68ce1846c`, `workspace:auth0` or `folder:planning#editor`
- a **[relation](#what-is-a-relation)**, e.g. `editor`, `member` or `parent_workspace`
- an **[object](#what-is-an-object)**, e.g `repo:auth0/express_jwt`, `domain:auth0.com` or `channel:marketing`
- a **[condition](#what-is-a-condition)** (optional), e.g. `{"condition": "in_allowed_ip_range", "context": {...}}`

An [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model), together with relationship tuples, determinate whether a [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) exists between a [user](#what-is-a-user) and an [object](#what-is-an-object).

Relationship tuples are usually shown in the following format:

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:new-roadmap',
    },
  ]}
/>

For more information, see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>
## What Is A Conditional Relationship Tuple?

A **conditional relationship tuple** is a [relationship tuple](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple) that represents a [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) conditioned upon the evaluation of a [condition](#what-is-a-condition).
</summary>

If a relationship tuple is conditioned, then that condition must to a truthy outcome for the relationship tuple to be permissible.

The following relationship tuple is a conditional relationship tuple because it is conditioned on `less_than_hundred`. If the expression for `less_than_hundred` is defined as `x < 100`, then the relationship is permissible because the expression - `20 < 100` - evaluates to a truthy outcome.

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      condition: {
        "name": "less_than_hundred",
        "context": {
          "x": 20
        }
      }
    },
  ]}
/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relationship?

A **relationship** is the realization of a relation between a user and an object.

</summary>

An [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model), together with [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple), determine whether a relationship exists between a user and an object. Relationships may be [direct](#what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships) or [implied](#what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Are Direct And Implied Relationships?

A **direct relationship** (R) between user X and object Y means the relationship tuple (user=X, relation=R, object=Y) exists, and the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> authorization model for that relation allows the direct relationship because of [direct relationship type restrictions](./modeling-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions)).

An **implied (or computed) relationship** (R) exists between user X and object Y if user X is related to an object Z that is in a direct or implied relationship with object Y, and the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> authorization model allows it.

</summary>

- `user:anne` has a direct relationship with `document:new-roadmap` as `viewer` if the [type definition](#what-is-a-type-definition) allows it with [direct relationship type restrictions](./modeling-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions), and one of the following [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple) exist:

  - <RelationshipTuplesViewer
      relationshipTuples={[
        {
          _description: 'Anne of type user is directly related to the document',
          user: 'user:anne',
          relation: 'viewer',
          object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        },
      ]}
    />

  - <RelationshipTuplesViewer
      relationshipTuples={[
        {
          _description: 'Everyone (`*`) of type user is directly related to the document',
          user: '*',
          relation: 'viewer',
          object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        },
      ]}
    />

  - <RelationshipTuplesViewer
      relationshipTuples={[
        {
          _description: 'The userset is directly related to this document',
          user: 'team:product#member',
          relation: 'viewer',
          object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        },
        {
          _description: 'AND Anne of type user is a member of a userset (e.g. team:product#member)',
          user: 'user:anne',
          relation: 'member',
          object: 'team:product#member',
        },
      ]}
    />

- `user:anne` has an **implied relationship** with `document:new-roadmap` as `viewer` if the type definition allows it, and the presence of relationship tuples satisfying the relationship exist.

  For example, assume the following type definition:

  <AuthzModelSnippetViewer
    configuration={{
      schema_version: '1.1',
      type_definitions: [
        {
          type: 'document',
          relations: {
            viewer: {
              union: {
                child: [
                  {
                    // a user can be assigned a direct `viewer` relation, i.e., not implied through another relation
                    this: {},
                  },
                  {
                    // a user who is related as an editor is also implicitly related as a viewer
                    computedUserset: {
                      relation: 'editor',
                    },
                  },
                ],
              },
            },
            editor: {
              this: {},
            },
          },
          metadata: {
            relations: {
              editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
              viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    }} skipVersion={true}
  />

  And assume the following relationship tuple exists in the system:

  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'editor',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      },
    ]}
  />

  In this case, the [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) between `user:anne` and `document:new-roadmap` as a `viewer` is implied from the direct `editor` relationship `user:anne` has with that same document. Thus, the following request to [check](#what-is-a-check-request) whether a viewer relationship exists between `user:anne` and `document:new-roadmap` will return `true`.

  <CheckRequestViewer user={'user:anne'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:new-roadmap'} allowed={true} />

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Check Request?

A **check request** is a call to the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> check endpoint, returning whether the user has a certain relationship with an object.

</summary>

Check requests use the `check` methods in the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> SDKs ([JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfga/sdk)/[Go SDK](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk)/[.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFga.Sdk)) by manually calling the [check endpoint](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check) using curl or in your code. The check endpoint responds with `{ "allowed": true }` if a relationship exists, and with `{ "allowed": false }` if the relationship does not.

For example, the following will check whether `anne` of type user has a `viewer` relation to `document:new-roadmap`:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:anne'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:new-roadmap'} allowed={true} />

For more information, see the [Relationship Queries page](./interacting/relationship-queries.mdx) and the official [Check API Reference](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A List Objects Request?

A **list objects request** is a call to the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> list objects endpoint that returns all objects of a given type that a user has a specified relationship with.

</summary>

List object requests are completed using the `listobjects` methods in the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> SDKs ([JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfga/sdk)/[Go SDK](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk)/[.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFga.Sdk)) by manually calling the [list objects endpoint](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects) using curl or in your code.

The list objects endpoint responds with a list of objects for a given type that the user has the specified relationship with.

For example, the following returns all the objects with document type for which `anne` of type user has a `viewer` relation with:

<ListObjectsRequestViewer
  authorizationModelId="1uHxCSuTP0VKPYSnkq1pbb1jeZw"
  objectType="document"
  relation="viewer"
  user="user:anne"
  expectedResults={['document:otherdoc', 'document:planning']}
/>

For more information, see the [Relationship Queries page](./interacting/relationship-queries.mdx) and the official [Check API Reference](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects).

</details>
<details>
<summary>

## What Are Contextual Tuples?

Contextual tuples are tuples that can be added to a check request and only exist within the context of that particular request.

</summary>

Similar to [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple), contextual tuples are composed of a user, relation and object. Unlike relationship tuples, they are not written to the store. However, if contextual tuples are sent alongside a check request in the context of a particular check request, they are treated if they had been written in the store.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->

For more information, see [Contextual and Time-Based Authorization](./modeling/contextual-time-based-authorization.mdx), [Authorization Through Organization Context](./modeling/organization-context-authorization.mdx) and [Check API Request Documentation](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check).

<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is Type Bound Public Access?

In <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/>, type bound public access (represented by `<type>:*`) is a special <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> syntax meaning "every object of [type]" when invoked as a user within a relationship tuple. For example, `user:*` represents every object of type `user` , including those not currently present in the system.

</summary>

For example, to indicate `document:new-roadmap` is publicly writable (in other words, has everyone of type `user` as an editor, add the following [relationship tuple](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple):

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:*',
      relation: 'editor',
