# Concepts

<DocumentationNotice />

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ProductLink}/> service answers <IntroductionSection linkName="authorization" section="authentication-vs-authorization"/> [checks](#what-is-a-check-request) by determining whether a **[relationship](#what-is-a-relation)** exists between an [object](#what-is-an-object) and a [user](#what-is-a-user). Checks takes into consideration the **[authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model)** of the system and the **[relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple)** present in the system at that time in order to make a decision.

In this guide you will learn about the most relevant FGA concepts, such as a type or an authorization model, and you will be able to explore them using the [FGA playground](https://play.fga.dev/).

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Type?

A **type** is a string. It should define a class of objects with similar characteristics.

</summary>

Examples of types:

- `workspace`
- `repository`
- `organization`
- `document`

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Type Definition?

A **type definition** is a configuration that defines all possible relations a user or another object can have in relation to this type.

</summary>

Code snippet below is an example of a type definition:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    type: 'document',
    relations: {
      viewer: {
        this: {},
      },
      commenter: {
        this: {},
      },
      editor: {
        this: {},
      },
      owner: {
        this: {},
      },
    },
  }}
/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is An Authorization Model?

An **authorization model** is a combination of one or more type definitions. This is used to define the permission model of a system.

</summary>

Code snippet below is an example of an authorization model:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
          commenter: {
            this: {},
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
          owner: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'domain',
        relations: {
          member: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

_Authorization model_, together with [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple), allow determination of whether a [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) exists between a [user](#what-is-a-user) and an [object](#what-is-an-object).

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> service has two different syntaxes to define the authorization model:

- A JSON syntax accepted by the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> API that follows closely the original syntax discussed in the [Zanzibar Paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). See [Equivalent Zanzibar Concepts](./configuration-language.mdx#equivalent-zanzibar-concepts).
- A DSL that we believe is easier to use and is used in the Auth0 FGA Playground to help with modeling. This is translated to the API-supported syntax before being sent to the API.

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Store?

A **store** is a <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> organization entity that owns an authorization model.

</summary>

A store contains all your data, including the [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model) and [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is An Object?

An **object** represents an entity in the system. We can define how various users have a relationship to it through relationship tuples and the authorization model.

</summary>

An object is a combination of a [type](#what-is-a-type) and an identifier.

For example:

- `workspace:fb83c013-3060-41f4-9590-d3233a67938f`
- `repository:auth0/express-jwt`
- `organization:org_ajUc9kJ`
- `document:new-roadmap`

[User](#what-is-a-user), [relation](#what-is-a-relation) and _object_ are the building blocks for [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

For more information, please see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A User?

A **user** is an entity in the system that can be related to an object.

</summary>

A **user** is

- any identifier: e.g. `anne` or `4179af14-f0c0-4930-88fd-5570c7bf6f59`
- any object: e.g. `workspace:fb83c013-3060-41f4-9590-d3233a67938f`, `repository:auth0/express-jwt` or `organization:org_ajUc9kJ`
- a group or a set of users (also called a **userset**): e.g. `organization:org_ajUc9kJ#members`, which represents the set of users related to the object `organization:org_ajUc9kJ` as `member`
- everyone, using the special syntax: `*`

_User_, [relation](#what-is-a-relation) and [object](#what-is-an-object) are the building blocks for [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

For more information, please see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relation?

A **relation** is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between objects of this type and other users in the system.

</summary>

Examples of relation:

- User can be a `reader` of a document
- Team can `administer` a repo
- User can be a `member` of a team

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relation Definition?

A **relation definition** lists the conditions or requirements under which this relationship would be possible.

</summary>

For example:

- `editor` describing a possible relationship between a user and an object in the `document` type allows the following:
  - **user identifier to object relationship**: the user id `anne` is related to the object `document:roadmap` as `editor`
  - **object to object relationship**: the object `application:ifft` is related to the object `document:roadmap` as `editor`
  - **userset to object relationship**: the userset `organization:auth0.com#member` is related to `document:roadmap` as `editor`
    - indicating that the set of users who are related to the object `organization:auth0.com` as `member` are related to the object `document:roadmap` as `editor`s
    - this allows for potential solutions to use-cases like sharing a document internally with all members of a company or a team
  - **everyone to object relationship**: everyone (`*`) is related to `document:roadmap` as `editor`
    - this is how one could model publicly editable documents

These would be defined in the [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model) as such:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
          commenter: {
            this: {},
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
          owner: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

:::info

In the configuration of the document type, we have four relations: `viewer`, `commenter`, `editor` and `owner`.

:::

[User](#what-is-a-user), _relation_ and [object](#what-is-an-object) are the building blocks for [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

For more information, please see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relationship Tuple?

A **relationship tuple** is a tuple consisting of a user, relation and object stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>.

</summary>

A **relationship tuple** consists of a:

- **[user](#what-is-a-user)**, e.g. `anne`, `3f7768e0-4fa7-4e93-8417-4da68ce1846c`, `workspace:auth0` or `folder:planning#editor`
- **[relation](#what-is-a-relation)**, e.g. `editor`, `member` or `parent_workspace`
- **[object](#what-is-an-object)**, e.g `repo:auth0/express_jwt`, `domain:auth0.com` or `channel:marketing`

An [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model), together with _relationship tuples_, allow the determination of whether a [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) exists between a [user](#what-is-a-user) and an [object](#what-is-an-object).

Throughout the documentation, you will encounter relationship tuples represented as:

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'anne',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:new-roadmap',
    },
  ]}
/>

For more information, please see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relationship?

A **relationship** is the realization of a relation between a user and an object.

</summary>

An [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model), together with [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple), allow the determination of whether a _relationship_ exists between a user and an object. Relationships may be classified as [_direct_](#what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships) or [_implied_](#what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Are Direct And Implied Relationships?

A **direct relationship** R between user X and object Y means the relationship tuple (user=X, relation=R, object=Y) exists, and the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> authorization model for that relation allows this direct relationship (by use of `self`).

An **implied (or computed) relationship** R exists between user X and object Y if user X is related to an object Z that is in a direct or implied relationship with object Y, and the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> authorization model allows it.

</summary>

- `anne` has a **direct relationship** with `document:new-roadmap` as `viewer` if the [type definition](#what-is-a-type-definition) allows it (allows [`self`](./configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-keyword)), and one of the following [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple) exist:

  - <RelationshipTuplesViewer
      relationshipTuples={[
        {
          _description: 'Anne is directly related to the document',
          user: 'anne',
          relation: 'viewer',
          object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        },
      ]}
    />

  - <RelationshipTuplesViewer
      relationshipTuples={[
        {
          _description: 'Everyone (`*`) is directly related to the document',
          user: '*',
          relation: 'viewer',
          object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        },
      ]}
    />

  - <RelationshipTuplesViewer
      relationshipTuples={[
        {
          _description: 'The userset is directly related to this document',
          user: 'team:product#member',
          relation: 'viewer',
          object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        },
        {
          _description: 'AND Anne is a member of a userset (e.g. team:product#member)',
          user: 'anne',
          relation: 'member',
          object: 'team:product#member',
        },
      ]}
    />

- `anne` has an **implied relationship** with `document:new-roadmap` as `viewer` if the type definition allows it, and the presence of relationship tuples satisfying the relationship exist.

  For example, assuming the following type definition:

  <AuthzModelSnippetViewer
    configuration={{
      type_definitions: [
        {
          type: 'document',
          relations: {
            viewer: {
              union: {
                child: [
                  {
                    // a user can be assigned a direct `viewer` relation, i.e., not implied through another relation
                    this: {},
                  },
                  {
                    // a user who is related as an editor is also implicitly related as a viewer
                    computedUserset: {
                      relation: 'editor',
                    },
                  },
                ],
              },
            },
            editor: {
              this: {},
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    }}
  />

  And assuming the following relationship tuple exists in the system:

  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'anne',
        relation: 'editor',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      },
    ]}
  />

  In this case, the [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) between `anne` and `document:new-roadmap` as a `viewer` is implied from the direct `editor` relationship `anne` has with that same document. Thus, the following request to [check](#what-is-a-check-request) whether a viewer relationship exists between `anne` and `document:new-roadmap` will return `true`.

  <CheckRequestViewer user={'anne'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:new-roadmap'} allowed={true} />

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Check Request?

A **check request** is a call to the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> check endpoint that returns whether the user has a certain relationship with an object.

</summary>

This can be done using the `check` methods in the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> SDKs ([JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfga/sdk)/[Go SDK](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk)/[.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFga.Sdk)), by manually calling the [check endpoint](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check) using curl, or in your code.

The check endpoint responds with `{ "allowed": true }` if a relationship exists, and with `{ "allowed": false }` if the relationship does not.

For example, the following will check whether `anne` has a `viewer` relation to `document:new-roadmap`:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'anne'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:new-roadmap'} allowed={true} />

For more information, please see [Comparison between check, read and expand](./interacting/check-read-expand.mdx) and [Check API Request Documentation](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Are Contextual Tuples?

Contextual tuples are tuples that can be added to a check request, and only exist within the context of that particular request.

</summary>

Similar to [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple), contextual tuples are composed of a user, relation and object.

Unlike relationship tuples, they are not written to the store. However, if contextual tuples are sent alongside a check request, in the context of this particular check request, they are treated if they had been written in the store.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->

For more information, please see [Contextual and Time-Based Authorization](./modeling/contextual-time-based-authorization.mdx), [Authorization Through Organization Context](./modeling/organization-context-authorization.mdx) and [Check API Request Documentation](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check).

<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## How Do I Represent "Everyone"?

In <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> the special syntax `*` means **everyone** when used as **user** in a relationship tuple.

</summary>

For example, in a case where you would like to indicate a certain document `document:new-roadmap` is publicly writable (i.e. has everyone as an editor), you can add the following [relationship tuple](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple):

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: '*',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:new-roadmap',
    },
  ]}
/>

Note that `*` has no special meaning when used in the `relation` or `object` properties. For example, `workspace:*` as an [object](#what-is-an-object) means a single object with the type `workspace` and identifier `*`.
For more information, please see [Modeling Public Access](./modeling/public-access.mdx) and [Advanced Modeling: Modeling Google Drive](./modeling/advanced/gdrive.mdx).
