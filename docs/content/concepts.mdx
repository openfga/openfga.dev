# Concepts

<DocumentationNotice />

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ProductLink}/> service answers <IntroductionSection linkName="authorization" section="authentication-vs-authorization"/> [checks](#what-is-a-check-request) by determining whether a **[relationship](#what-is-a-relation)** exists between an [object](#what-is-an-object) and a [user](#what-is-a-user). Checks takes into consideration the **[authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model)** of the system and the **[relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple)** present in the system at that time in order to make a decision.

In this guide you will learn about the most relevant FGA concepts, such as a type or an authorization model, and you will be able to explore them using the [FGA playground](https://play.fga.dev/).

## What Is A Type?

A **type** is a string. It should define a class of objects with similar characteristics.

</summary>

Examples of types:

- `workspace`
- `repository`
- `organization`
- `document`

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Type Definition?

A **type definition** is a configuration that defines all possible relations a user or another object can have in relation to this type.

</summary>

Code snippet below is an example of a type definition:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type: 'document',
    relations: {
      viewer: {
        this: {},
      },
      commenter: {
        this: {},
      },
      editor: {
        this: {},
      },
      owner: {
        this: {},
      },
    },
    metadata: {
      relations: {
        viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
        commenter: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
        editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
        owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
      },
    },
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is An Authorization Model?

An **authorization model** is a combination of one or more type definitions. This is used to define the permission model of a system.

</summary>

Code snippet below is an example of an authorization model:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
          commenter: {
            this: {},
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
          owner: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'domain', relation: 'member' }, { type: 'user' }] },
            commenter: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'domain', relation: 'member' }, { type: 'user' }] },
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'domain', relation: 'member' }, { type: 'user' }] },
            owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'domain', relation: 'member' }, { type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'domain',
        relations: {
          member: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            member: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

_Authorization model_, together with [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple), allow determination of whether a [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) exists between a [user](#what-is-a-user) and an [object](#what-is-an-object).

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> service has two different syntaxes to define the authorization model:

- A JSON syntax accepted by the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> API that follows closely the original syntax discussed in the [Zanzibar Paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). See [Equivalent Zanzibar Concepts](./configuration-language.mdx#equivalent-zanzibar-concepts).
- A DSL that we believe is easier to use and is used in the Okta FGA Playground to help with modeling. This is translated to the API-supported syntax before being sent to the API.

Learn more about the <UpdateProductNameInLinks link="./configuration-language" name="{ProductName} Configuration Language" />.

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Store?

A "store" is a <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> entity used for organizing data needed to answer authorization checks.

</summary>

Each store contains one or more versions of an [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model) and may contain various [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

Store data such as the authorization model and relationship tuples cannot be shared across stores, so it is highly recommended to store all data that may be related and may affect your authorization result in a single store.

For completely separate authorization needs or isolated environments where data from one should not affect another (e.g. development/prod), you may want to create separate stores.

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is An Object?

An **object** represents an entity in the system. We can define how various users have a relationship to it through relationship tuples and the authorization model.

</summary>

An object is a combination of a [type](#what-is-a-type) and an identifier.

For example:

- `workspace:fb83c013-3060-41f4-9590-d3233a67938f`
- `repository:auth0/express-jwt`
- `organization:org_ajUc9kJ`
- `document:new-roadmap`

[User](#what-is-a-user), [relation](#what-is-a-relation) and _object_ are the building blocks for [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

For more information, please see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A User?

A **user** is an entity in the system that can be related to an object.

</summary>

A **user** is is a combination of a [type](#what-is-a-type), an identifier and an optional relation.

For example,

- any identifier: e.g. `user:anne` or `user:4179af14-f0c0-4930-88fd-5570c7bf6f59`
- any object: e.g. `workspace:fb83c013-3060-41f4-9590-d3233a67938f`, `repository:auth0/express-jwt` or `organization:org_ajUc9kJ`
- a group or a set of users (also called a **userset**): e.g. `organization:org_ajUc9kJ#members`, which represents the set of users related to the object `organization:org_ajUc9kJ` as `member`
- everyone, using the special syntax: `*`

_User_, [relation](#what-is-a-relation) and [object](#what-is-an-object) are the building blocks for [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

For more information, please see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relation?

A **relation** is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system.

</summary>

Examples of relation:

- User can be a `reader` of a document
- Team can `administer` a repo
- User can be a `member` of a team

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relation Definition?

A **relation definition** lists the conditions or requirements under which this relationship would be possible.

</summary>

For example:

- `editor` describing a possible relationship between a user and an object in the `document` type allows the following:
  - **user identifier to object relationship**: the user id `anne` of type `user` is related to the object `document:roadmap` as `editor`
  - **object to object relationship**: the object `application:ifft` is related to the object `document:roadmap` as `editor`
  - **userset to object relationship**: the userset `organization:auth0.com#member` is related to `document:roadmap` as `editor`
    - indicating that the set of users who are related to the object `organization:auth0.com` as `member` are related to the object `document:roadmap` as `editor`s
    - this allows for potential solutions to use-cases like sharing a document internally with all members of a company or a team
  - **everyone to object relationship**: everyone (`*`) is related to `document:roadmap` as `editor`
    - this is how one could model publicly editable documents

These would be defined in the [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model) as such:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
          commenter: {
            this: {},
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
          owner: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            commenter: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
    ],
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

:::info

In the configuration of the document type, we have four relations: `viewer`, `commenter`, `editor` and `owner`.

:::

[User](#what-is-a-user), _relation_ and [object](#what-is-an-object) are the building blocks for [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple).

For more information, please see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Directly Related User Type?

A **directly related user type** is an array specified in the type definition to indicate what types of users can be directly related to that relation.

</summary>

For the following model, only [relationship tuple](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple) with [user](#what-is-a-user) [type](#what-is-a-type) `user` may be assigned to document.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }} skipVersion={true}
/>

Relationship tuple with user `user:anne` or `user:3f7768e0-4fa7-4e93-8417-4da68ce1846c` may be written for objects with type `document` and relation `viewer`, so writing `{"user": "user:anne","relation":"viewer","object":"document:roadmap"}` will succeed.
Relationship tuple writes with user type that is not allowed for the `viewer` relation on objects of type `document`, for example `workspace:auth0` or `folder:planning#editor` will be rejected, so writing `{"user": "folder:product","relation":"viewer","object":"document:roadmap"}` will fail.
This will affect only relations that are [directly related](#what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships) and have [the direct relationship type restrictions](./configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions) in their relation definition.

</details>

<details>
<summary>
## What is a Condition?

A **Condition** is a function composed of one or more parameters and an expression which must evaluate to a boolean outcome. Expressions are defined using [Google's Common Expression Language (CEL)](https://github.com/google/cel-spec).
</summary>

For example, in the following snippet `less_than_hundred` defines a Condition which evaluates to a boolean outcome. The provided parameter `x`, defined as an integer type, is used in the boolean expression `x < 100`. The condition will return a truthy outcome if the expression returns a truthy outcome and false otherwise.
```
condition less_than_hundred(x: int) {
  x < 100
}
```
</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relationship Tuple?

A **relationship tuple** is composed of a base tuple/triplet consisting of a user, relation and object and an optional condition which applies to it (see [Conditional Relationship Tuples](#what-is-a-conditional-relationship-tuple) for more info). Relationship tuples are written and stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>.

</summary>

A **relationship tuple** consists of a:

- **[user](#what-is-a-user)**, e.g. `user:anne`, `user:3f7768e0-4fa7-4e93-8417-4da68ce1846c`, `workspace:auth0` or `folder:planning#editor`
- **[relation](#what-is-a-relation)**, e.g. `editor`, `member` or `parent_workspace`
- **[object](#what-is-an-object)**, e.g `repo:auth0/express_jwt`, `domain:auth0.com` or `channel:marketing`
- **[condition](#what-is-a-condition)** (optional), e.g. `{"condition": "in_allowed_ip_range", "context": {...}}`

An [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model), together with _relationship tuples_, allow the determination of whether a [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) exists between a [user](#what-is-a-user) and an [object](#what-is-an-object).

Throughout the documentation, you will encounter relationship tuples represented as:

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:new-roadmap',
    },
  ]}
/>

For more information, please see [Direct Access](./modeling/direct-access.mdx).

</details>

<details>
<summary>
## What Is A Conditional Relationship Tuple?

A **conditional relationship tuple** is a [relationship tuple](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple) which represents a [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) conditioned upon the evaluation of some [Condition](#what-is-a-condition).
</summary>

If a relationship tuple is conditioned, then the condition which the tuple is conditioned upon must evaluate to a truthy outcome for the relationship tuple to be considered a permissible relationship.

The following relationship tuple is a conditional relationship tuple because it is conditioned on `less_than_hundred`. If the expression for `less_than_hundred` is defined as `x < 100`, then the relationship is considered permissible because the expression evaluates to a truthy outcome since `20 < 100`.

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      condition: {
        "name": "less_than_hundred",
        "context": {
          "x": 20
        }
      }
    },
  ]}
/>

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Relationship?

A **relationship** is the realization of a relation between a user and an object.

</summary>

An [authorization model](#what-is-an-authorization-model), together with [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple), allow the determination of whether a _relationship_ exists between a user and an object. Relationships may be classified as [_direct_](#what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships) or [_implied_](#what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Are Direct And Implied Relationships?

A **direct relationship** R between user X and object Y means the relationship tuple (user=X, relation=R, object=Y) exists, and the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> authorization model for that relation allows this direct relationship (by use of [direct relationship type restrictions](./configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions)).

An **implied (or computed) relationship** R exists between user X and object Y if user X is related to an object Z that is in a direct or implied relationship with object Y, and the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> authorization model allows it.

</summary>

- `user:anne` has a **direct relationship** with `document:new-roadmap` as `viewer` if the [type definition](#what-is-a-type-definition) allows it (allows [`direct relationship type restrictions`](./configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions)), and one of the following [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple) exist:

  - <RelationshipTuplesViewer
      relationshipTuples={[
        {
          _description: 'Anne of type user is directly related to the document',
          user: 'user:anne',
          relation: 'viewer',
          object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        },
      ]}
    />

  - <RelationshipTuplesViewer
      relationshipTuples={[
        {
          _description: 'Everyone (`*`) of type user is directly related to the document',
          user: '*',
          relation: 'viewer',
          object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        },
      ]}
    />

  - <RelationshipTuplesViewer
      relationshipTuples={[
        {
          _description: 'The userset is directly related to this document',
          user: 'team:product#member',
          relation: 'viewer',
          object: 'document:new-roadmap',
        },
        {
          _description: 'AND Anne of type user is a member of a userset (e.g. team:product#member)',
          user: 'user:anne',
          relation: 'member',
          object: 'team:product#member',
        },
      ]}
    />

- `user:anne` has an **implied relationship** with `document:new-roadmap` as `viewer` if the type definition allows it, and the presence of relationship tuples satisfying the relationship exist.

  For example, assuming the following type definition:

  <AuthzModelSnippetViewer
    configuration={{
      schema_version: '1.1',
      type_definitions: [
        {
          type: 'document',
          relations: {
            viewer: {
              union: {
                child: [
                  {
                    // a user can be assigned a direct `viewer` relation, i.e., not implied through another relation
                    this: {},
                  },
                  {
                    // a user who is related as an editor is also implicitly related as a viewer
                    computedUserset: {
                      relation: 'editor',
                    },
                  },
                ],
              },
            },
            editor: {
              this: {},
            },
          },
          metadata: {
            relations: {
              editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
              viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            },
          },
        },
      ],
    }} skipVersion={true}
  />

  And assuming the following relationship tuple exists in the system:

  <RelationshipTuplesViewer
    relationshipTuples={[
      {
        user: 'user:anne',
        relation: 'editor',
        object: 'document:new-roadmap',
      },
    ]}
  />

  In this case, the [relationship](#what-is-a-relationship) between `user:anne` and `document:new-roadmap` as a `viewer` is implied from the direct `editor` relationship `user:anne` has with that same document. Thus, the following request to [check](#what-is-a-check-request) whether a viewer relationship exists between `user:anne` and `document:new-roadmap` will return `true`.

  <CheckRequestViewer user={'user:anne'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:new-roadmap'} allowed={true} />

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A Check Request?

A **check request** is a call to the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> check endpoint that returns whether the user has a certain relationship with an object.

</summary>

This can be done using the `check` methods in the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> SDKs ([JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfga/sdk)/[Go SDK](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk)/[.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFga.Sdk)), by manually calling the [check endpoint](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check) using curl, or in your code.

The check endpoint responds with `{ "allowed": true }` if a relationship exists, and with `{ "allowed": false }` if the relationship does not.

For example, the following will check whether `anne` of type user has a `viewer` relation to `document:new-roadmap`:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:anne'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:new-roadmap'} allowed={true} />

For more information, please see the [Relationship Queries page](./interacting/relationship-queries.mdx) and the official [Check API Reference](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check).

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is A List Objects Request?

A **list objects request** is a call to the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> list objects endpoint that returns all the objects of a given type that a user has a specified relationship with.

</summary>

This can be done using the `listobjects` methods in the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> SDKs ([JavaScript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfga/sdk)/[Go SDK](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk)/[.NET SDK](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFga.Sdk)), by manually calling the [list objects endpoint](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects) using curl, or in your code.

The list objects endpoint responds with a list of objects for a given type that the user has the specified relationship with.

For example, the following will return all the objects with document type for which `anne` of type user has a `viewer` relation with:

<ListObjectsRequestViewer
  authorizationModelId="1uHxCSuTP0VKPYSnkq1pbb1jeZw"
  objectType="document"
  relation="viewer"
  user="user:anne"
  expectedResults={['document:otherdoc', 'document:planning']}
/>

For more information, please see the [Relationship Queries page](./interacting/relationship-queries.mdx) and the official [Check API Reference](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects).

</details>
<details>
<summary>

## What Are Contextual Tuples?

Contextual tuples are tuples that can be added to a check request, and only exist within the context of that particular request.

</summary>

Similar to [relationship tuples](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple), contextual tuples are composed of a user, relation and object.

Unlike relationship tuples, they are not written to the store. However, if contextual tuples are sent alongside a check request, in the context of this particular check request, they are treated if they had been written in the store.

<!-- markdown-link-check-disable -->

For more information, please see [Contextual and Time-Based Authorization](./modeling/contextual-time-based-authorization.mdx), [Authorization Through Organization Context](./modeling/organization-context-authorization.mdx) and [Check API Request Documentation](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check).

<!-- markdown-link-check-enable -->

</details>

<details>
<summary>

## What Is Type Bound Public Access?

In <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/>, type bound public access (represented by `<type>:*`) is a special <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> syntax meaning **every object of that type** when used as a _user_ within a _relationship tuple_. For example, `user:*` represents every object of type `user` (including those not currently present in the system).

</summary>

For example, in a case where you would like to indicate a certain document `document:new-roadmap` is publicly writable (i.e. has everyone of type user as an editor), you can add the following [relationship tuple](#what-is-a-relationship-tuple):

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
