# Introduction to Authorization and <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/>

<DocumentationNotice />

OpenFGA relies on several understandings of [authorization](#authentication-vs-authorization), including [fine-grained authorization](#what-is-fine-grained-authorization-fga), [role-based access control](#what-are-role-based-access-control-rbac-and-attribute-based-access-control-abac), [attribute-based access control](#what-are-role-based-access-control-rbac-and-attribute-based-access-control-abac), and [relationship-based access control](#what-is-relationship-based-access-control-rebac).

## What Is OpenFGA?

**OpenFGA** is an open source solution to [Fine-Grained Authorization](#what-is-fine-grained-authorization-fga), or **FGA**, that applies the concept of [relationship-based access control](#what-is-relationship-based-access-control-rebac), or **ReBAC**. It was created by the [Okta FGA](https://docs.fga.dev/) team and inspired by [Zanzibar](#what-is-zanzibar). Designed for reliability and low latency at a high scale, OpenFGA offers both HTTP and GRPC APIs, as well as SDKs for programming languages like [Node.js/JavaScript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfga/sdk), [GoLang](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk), [.NET](https://www.nuget.org/packages/OpenFga.Sdk), [Python](https://pypi.org/project/openfga-sdk), and [Java](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/dev.openfga/openfga-sdk), with additional SDKs and integrations (including Rego) planned for future releases.

## Authentication vs Authorization

[**Authentication**](https://auth0.com/intro-to-iam/what-is-authentication/) (or **AuthN**) ensures a user's identity. [**Authorization**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authorization) (or **AuthZ**) determines if a user can perform a certain action on a particular resource.

For example, when you log in to Google, Authentication verifies that your username and password are correct. Authorization checks if you can access a given Google service. [For more information about AuthN vs AuthZ, click here.](https://www.okta.com/identity-101/authentication-vs-authorization/).

## What Is Fine-Grained Authorization?

**Fine-Grained Authorization** (FGA) allows admininstrators to to grant individual users access to specific objects or resources in a system. Well-designed FGA systems allow millions of objects, users and relations to change rapidly as objects are added and access permissions are updated. A notable example of fine-grained authorization is Google Drive: access can be granted either to documents or to folders, as well as to individual users or users as a group, and access rights regularly change as new documents are created and shared with specific users or groups.

## What Are Role-Based Access Control And Attribute-Based Access Control?

In [**Role-Based Access Control**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-based_access_control) (RBAC), permissions are assigned to users based on their role in a system. For example, a user needs the `editor` role to edit content. [For more information about RBAC, click here.](https://auth0.com/docs/manage-users/access-control/rbac)

In [**Attribute-Based Access Control**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control) (ABAC), permissions are granted based on a set of attributes that a user or resource possess. For example, a user assigned both `marketing` and `manager` attributes is entitled to publish and delete posts that have a `marketing` attribute. [For more information about ABAC, click here.](https://www.okta.com/blog/2020/09/attribute-based-access-control-abac/)

## What Is Relationship-Based Access Control?

**Relationship-Based Access Control** (ReBAC) allows user access rules to be conditional on relations that a given user has with a given object *and* that object's relationship other objects. For example, a given user can view a given document if the user has access to the document's parent folder.

## What Is Zanzibar?

**[Zanzibar](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/)** is Google's global authorization system across Google's product suite. It uses object-relation-user tuples to store relation data, then checks those relations for a match between a user and an object.
