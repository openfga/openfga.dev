# Managing Group Access

<DocumentationNotice />

<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> allows you to grant a group of users access to a particular object.

<CardBox title="When to use" appearance="filled">

Relationship tuples are helpful when you want to specify that a group of users all have the same relation to an object. For example, <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> allows you to:

- Grant a group of `engineers` `viewer` access to `roadmap.doc`
- Create a `block_list` of `members` who can't access a `document`
- Share a `document` with a `team`
- Grant `viewer` access to a `photo` to `followers` only
- Make a `file` viewable for all `users` within an `organization`
- Manage access to a `database` for `users` in a certain `locale`

</CardBox>

## Before you start

Familiarize yourself with basic <ProductConcept /> before you continue.

<details>
<summary>

In the example below, you have the following <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" /> with two <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="types" />:

- `company` that can have an `employee` relation
- `document` that can have a `reader` relation.

</summary>

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'company',
        relations: {
          employee: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            employee: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          reader: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            reader: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'company', relation: 'employee' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

<hr />

In addition, the following concepts are important to group access management:

### Modeling user groups

<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> allows you to add users to groups and grant groups access to an object. [For more information, see User Groups.](../modeling/user-groups.mdx)

### <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> Concepts

- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="Type" />: a class of objects that have similar characteristics
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="User" />: an entity in the system that can be related to an object
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system
- An <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="Object" />: represents an entity in the system. Users' relationships to it can be define through relationship tuples and the authorization model
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" />: a grouping consisting of a user, a relation and an object stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>

</details>

## Step by step

### 01. Adding Company To The Document

The following <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" /> assigns ever `employee` of a type `company`  a `reader` relationship with a particular object of type `document`, in this case `document:planning`):

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: 'Every employee in the company can read document:planning',
      user: 'company:xyz#employee',
      relation: 'reader',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 02. Add an employee to the company

Below is a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="relationship tuple" /> specifying that `Anne` is an `employee` of `company:xyz`:

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'employee',
      object: 'company:xyz',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 03. Checking an individual member's access to an object

Call the Check API to verify that Anne can read `document:planning` returns true:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:anne'} relation={'reader'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={true} />

The same check for Becky, a different user, returns false, because Becky does not have an `employee` relationship with `company:xyz`:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:becky'} relation={'reader'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={false} />
