# Managing Group Access

<DocumentationNotice />

In this guide you will learn how to give a group of users access to a particular object.

<CardBox title="When to use" appearance="filled" description=<div>

Adding a relationship tuple specifying that a group has a relation to an object is helpful in cases where you want to encompass a set of users with the same relation to an object. For example:

- Grant a group of `engineers` `viewer` access to `roadmap.doc`
- Create a `block_list` of `members` who can't access a `document`
- Sharing a `document` with a `team`
- Granting `viewer` access to a `photo` to `followers` only
- Making a `file` viewable for all `users` within an `organization`
- Restricting access from or to `users` in a certain `locale`

## Before You Start

In order to understand this guide correctly you must be familiar with some <ProductConcept /> and know how to develop the things that we will list below.

<details>
<summary>

Assume that you have the following <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" />.<br />
You have two <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="types" />:

- `company` that can have a `employee` relation
- `document` that can have a `reader` relation.

</summary>

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'company',
        relations: {
          employee: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          reader: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

In addition, you will need to know the following:

### Modeling User Groups

You need to know how to add users to groups and grant groups access to an object. [Learn more â†’](../modeling/user-groups.mdx)

### <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> Concepts

- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="Type" />: a class of objects that have similar characteristics
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="User" />: an entity in the system that can be related to an object
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system
- An <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="Object" />: represents an entity in the system. Users' relationships to it can be define through relationship tuples and the authorization model
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" />: a grouping consisting of a user, a relation and an object stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>

</details>

## Step By Step

### 01. Adding Company To The Document

If we want to have every `employee` of a type `company` have a `reader` relationship with a particular object of type `document` (in this case `document:planning`), we need to add a tuple like so:

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: 'Every employee in the company can read document:planning',
      user: 'company:xyz#employee',
      relation: 'reader',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 02. Adding Employee To The Company

If we also write a tuple that says that Anne is a `employee` of `company:xyz`, like so:

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'employee',
      object: 'company:xyz',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 03. Checking An Individual Member's Access To An Object

Then a call to the Check API to see whether Anne can read `document:planning` will return true:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:anne'} relation={'reader'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={true} />

The same check for a different user Becky, however, will return false, because Becky does not have an `employee` relationship with `company:xyz`:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:becky'} relation={'reader'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={false} />
