# Transactional Writes

<DocumentationNotice />

Using<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>, you can update multiple <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="relationship tuples" /> in a single transaction.

<CardBox title="When to use" appearance="filled">

Updating multiple relationship tuples can keep your system state consistent.

</CardBox>

## Before you start

Familiarize yourself with basic <ProductConcept /> before completing this guide.

<details>
<summary>

In the following <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" />, there is <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="type" /> called `tweet` that can have a `reader`. There is another type called `user` that can have a `follower` and `followed_by` relationship.

</summary>

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'tweet',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: {
              directly_related_user_types: [
                { type: 'user' },
                { type: 'user', wildcard: {} },
                { type: 'user', relation: 'follower' },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'user',
        relations: {
          follower: {
            this: {},
          },
          followed_by: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            follower: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            followed_by: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}

In addition:

### Direct access

Creating an authorization model and a relationship tuple grants a user access to an object. To learn more, [read about Direct Access.](../modeling/direct-access.mdx)

### Modeling public access

The following example uses public access. To learn more, [read about Public Access.](../modeling/direct-access.mdx)

### <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> concepts

- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="Type" />: a class of objects that have similar characteristics
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="User" />: an entity in the system that can be related to an object
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" />: a group stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> that consists of a user, a relation, and an object

## Step by step

### 01. Add and remove relationship tuples in the same transaction

A call to the Write API can add or delete tuples in your store. For example, the following tuple makes `tweet:1` public by making everyone a `viewer`:

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:*',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'tweet:1',
    },
  ]}
/>

Deleting the previous tuple converts this `tweet` to private:

<WriteRequestViewer
  deleteRelationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:*',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'tweet:1',
    },
  ]}
/>

By removing the tuple, we made the tweet visible to no-one, which may not be what we want.

<details>
<summary>Limitations on duplicate tuples in a single request</summary>

<br/>
When using the Write API, you cannot include the same tuple (same user, relation, and object) in both the writes and deletes arrays within a single request. The API will return an error with code `cannot_allow_duplicate_tuples_in_one_request` if duplicate tuples are detected.

For example, this request would fail:

```bash
curl -X POST 'http://localhost:8080/stores/{store_id}/write' \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "writes": {
      "tuple_keys": [{
        "user": "user:anne",
        "relation": "member",
        "object": "group:2"
      }]
    },
    "deletes": {
      "tuple_keys": [{
        "user": "user:anne",
        "relation": "member",
        "object": "group:2"
      }]
    }
  }'
```

</details>

:::tip
For handling cases where you need to write tuples that might already exist or delete tuples that might not exist, check out [Duplicate Writes](./duplicate-writes.mdx) which provides resilient write operations.
:::

The Write API allows you to send up to 100 unique tuples in the request. (This limit applies to the sum of both writes and deletes in that request). This means we can submit one API call that converts the `tweet` from public to visible to only the `user`'s followers.

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: "Anne's followers can view tweet:1",
      user: 'user:anne#follower',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'tweet:1',
    },
  ]}
  deleteRelationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: 'tweet:1 is no longer viewable by everyone (*)',
      user: 'user:*',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'tweet:1',
    },
  ]}
  allowedLanguages={[
    SupportedLanguage.JS_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.GO_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.DOTNET_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.PYTHON_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.JAVA_SDK,
    SupportedLanguage.CURL,
    SupportedLanguage.RPC,
  ]}
/>

### 02. Add multiple related relationship tuples in the same transaction

Sending multiple tuples per request can also help maintain consistency. For example, if `anne` follows `becky`, you can save the following two tuples or neither of them:

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: 'Anne is a follower of Becky',
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'follower',
      object: 'user:becky',
    },
    {
      _description: 'Becky is followed by Anne',
      user: 'user:becky',
      relation: 'followed_by',
      object: 'user:anne',
    },
  ]}
/>

:::info
In this case, the type `user` exists because users can be related to each other, so users now are a type in the system.
:::

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/> service attempts to perform all the changes sent in a single Write API call in one transaction. If it cannot complete all the changes, it rejects all of them.
