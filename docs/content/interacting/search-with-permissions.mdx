# Search With Permissions

<DocumentationNotice />

Once you implement fine-grained authorization to protect your resources, search becomes a more complex problem, because the user's access to each resource now has to be validated before the resource can be shown.

The search problem can then be summarized as:

> "Given a particular search filter and a sort order, what objects can the user access"?

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> service does not store object metadata (names of files, creation dates, time of last update, etc), which means completing any search request by filtering and sorting according to certain criteria will require data from your database.

The services responsible for performing these actions are:

- Filter: Your database
- Sort: Your database
- Authorize: <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>

To return the set of results that match the user's search query, you will need to get the intersection of the results from the services above.

## Possible Options

There are three possible ways to do this:

### Option 1: Search, Then Check

Pre-filter, then call <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> Check endpoint.

1. Filter and sort on your database.
1. Call [`/check`](./check-read-expand.mdx#check) in parallel on each object returned from your database.
1. Filter out objects the user does not have access to.
1. Return the filtered result to the user.

### Option 2: Build A Local Index From Changes Endpoint, Search, Then Check

Consume the `GET /changes` endpoint to create a local index you can use to do an intersection on the two sets of results.

1. Call the <UpdateProductNameInLinks link="/api/service#/Relationship%20Tuples/ReadChanges" name="{ProductName} changes API" />.
1. For the particular authorization model version(s) you are using in production, flatten/expand the changes (e.g. `user:anne, writer, doc:planning` becomes two tuples: `user:anne, writer, doc:planning` and `user:anne, reader, doc:planning`).
1. Build the intersection between the objects in your database and the flattened/expanded state you created.
1. You can then call `/check` on each resource in the resulting set before returning the response to filter out any resource with permissions revoked but whose authorization data has not made it into your index yet.

### Option 3: Build A List Of IDs, Then Search

:::note
Support for this option has not been added to <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> yet, but we will keep it here for the sake of completion.
:::

Call the <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> API to get a list of object IDs the user has access to, then run the filter restricting by the object IDs returned.

1. Call <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>'s API to get the list of all resources a user can access.
1. Pass in the set of object IDs to the database query to limit the search.
1. Return the filtered result to the user.

## Choosing The Best Option

Which option to choose among the three listed above depends on the following criteria:

1. Number of objects that your database can return from a search query
2. Number of objects of a certain type the user could have access to
3. Percentage of objects in a type the user could have access to

Consider the following scenarios:

**A.** The _number of objects a search query could return from the database_ is _low_.

**[Search then Check](#option-1-search-then-check)** is the recommended solution.

Use-case: Situations where the search query can be optimized to return a small number of results.

**B.** The _number of objects of a certain type the user could have access to_ is _low_, and the _percentage of objects in a namespace a user could have access to_ is _high_.

**[Search then Check](#option-1-search-then-check)** is recommended to get the final list of results.

Note that this use case, because the user has access to a low number of objects which are still a high percentage of the total objects in the system, that means that the total number of objects in the system is low.

**C.** The _number of objects of a certain type the user could have access to_ is _low_ (~ 100), and the _percentage of the total objects that the user can have access to_ is also _low_.

In this case, an API to return the list of all objects a user can access would make sense. You can query this API to get a list of object IDs and then pass these IDs to your filter function to limit the search to them.

As this number increases, this solution becomes impractical, because you would need to paginate over multiple pages to get the entire list before being able to search and sort. A partial list from the API is not enough, because you won't be able to sort using it.

So while **[List of IDs then Search](#option-3-build-a-list-of-ids-then-search)** would be useful for this in some situations, we would recommend **[Local Index from Changes Endpoint, Search then Check](#option-2-build-a-local-index-from-changes-endpoint-search-then-check)** for the cases when the number of objects is high enough. Until <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> implements an endpoint to return a list of object IDs, local index is recommended for all situations.

**D.** The _number of objects of a certain type the user could have access to_ is _high_, and the _percentage of the total objects that the user can have access to_ is _low_.

The recommended option for this case is to use **[Local Index from Changes Endpoint, Search then Check](#option-2-build-a-local-index-from-changes-endpoint-search-then-check)**.

- _List of IDs then Search_ would not work because you would have to get and paginate across thousands or tens of thousands (or in some cases more) of results from <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>, only after you have retrieved the entire set can you start searching within your database for matching results. This would mean that your user could be waiting for a long time before they can start seeing results.

- _Search then Check_ would also not be ideal, as you will be retrieving and checking against a lot of items and discarding most of them.

Use case: Searching in Google Drive, where the list of documents and folders that a user has access to can be very high, but it still is a small percentage of the entire set of documents in Google Drive.

**E.** The _number of objects of a certain type the user could have access to_ is _high_, and the _percentage of the total objects that the user can have access to_ is also _high_.

In this case a **[Local Index from Changes Endpoint, Search then Check](#option-2-build-a-local-index-from-changes-endpoint-search-then-check)** would be useful. If you do not want to maintain a local index, and if the user can access a high percentage of the total, meaning that the user is more likely than not to have access to the results returned by the search query, then **[Search then Check](#option-1-search-then-check)** would work just as well.

Use-case: Searching on Twitter. Most Twitter users have their profiles set to public, so the user is more likely to have access to the tweets when performing a search. So searching first then running checks against the set of returned results would be appropriate.
