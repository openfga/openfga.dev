# Relationship Queries: Check, Read, Expand, ListObjects and ListUsers

<DocumentationNotice />

In this guide you will learn the uses of and limitations for the Check, Read, Expand, and ListObjects API endpoints.

## Before you start

In order to understand this guide correctly you must be familiar with some <ProductConcept /> and know how to develop the things that we will list below.

<details>
<summary>

Assume that you have the following <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" />.<br />
You have a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="type" /> called `document` that can have a `reader`
and `writer`. All writers are readers. `bob` has a `writer` relationship with `document:planning`.

</summary>

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          writer: {
            this: {},
          },
          reader: {
            union: {
              child: [
                {
                  this: {},
                },
                {
                  computedUserset: {
                    object: '',
                    relation: 'writer',
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            writer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            reader: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: 'Bob has writer relationship with planning document',
      user: 'user:bob',
      relation: 'writer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

<hr />

In addition, you will need to know the following:

### Direct access

You need to know how to create an authorization model and create a relationship tuple to grant a user access to an object. [Learn more â†’](../modeling/direct-access.mdx)

### <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> concepts

- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="Type" />: a class of objects that have similar characteristics
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="User" />: an entity in the system that can be related to an object
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system
- An <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="Object" />: represents an entity in the system. Users' relationships to it can be define through relationship tuples and the authorization model
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" />: a grouping consisting of a user, a relation and an object stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>

</details>

## Check

### What is it for?

The [Check API](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check) is an API endpoint that returns whether the user has a certain relationship with an object. <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> will resolve all prerequisite relationships to establish whether a relationship exists.

### When to use?

Check can be called if you need to establish whether a particular user has a specific relationship with a particular object.

For example, you can call check to determine whether `bob` has a `reader` relationship with `document:planning`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:bob'} relation={'reader'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={true} />

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> API will return `true` because there is an implied relationship as

- every `writer` is also a `reader`
- `bob` is a `writer` for `document:planning`

### Caveats and when not to use it

Check is designed to answer the question "Does user:X have relationship Y with object:Z?". It is _not_ designed to answer the following questions:

- "Who has relationship Y with object:Z?"
- "What are the objects that userX has relationship Y with?"
- "Why does user:X have relationship Y with object:Z?"

## Batch Check

### What is it for?

The [Batch Check API](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/BatchCheck) is an API endpoint that allows you to check multiple user-object-relationship combinations in a single request. 

### When to use?

Batching authorization checks together in a single request significantly reduces overall network latency.

Two scenarios are common to use Batch Check:
1. When determining if the user has access to a list of objects (such as [Option 1 in Search with Permissions](./search-with-permissions.mdx#option-1-search-then-check)), filter and sort on your database, then call `/batch-check`. Repeat to perform pagination.
2. When determining fields on a web page the user has access to, call `/batch-check` for every relation necessary to show/hide each field.  

For example, you can call Batch Check to determine whether `bob` has `can_view_name`, `can_view_dob`, and `can_view_ssn` relationships with `patient_record:1`.

<BatchCheckRequestViewer
  checks={[
    {
      user: 'user:bob',
      relation: 'can_view_name',
      object: 'patient_record:1',
      correlation_id: '1',
      allowed: true
    },
    {
      user: 'user:bob',
      relation: 'can_view_dob',
      object: 'patient_record:1',
      correlation_id: '2',
      allowed: true
    },
    {
      user: 'user:bob',
      relation: 'can_view_ssn',
      object: 'patient_record:1',
      correlation_id: '3',
      allowed: false
    }
  ]}
  skipSetup={true}
/>

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> API will return `true` depending on the level of access assigned to that user and the implied relationships inherited in the authorization model.


### Caveats and when not to use it

If you are making less than 10 checks, it may be faster to call the [Check API](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/Check) in parallel instead of Batch Check. 

## Read

### What Is It For?

The [Read API](/api/service#Relationship%20Tuples/Read) is an API endpoint that returns the relationship tuples that are stored in the system that satisfy a query.

### When to use?

Read can be called if you need to get all the stored relationship tuples that relate:

1. [a particular user to any objects of a specific type with a particular relation](#1-a-particular-user-to-any-objects-of-a-specific-type-with-a-particular-relation)
2. [a particular user to any objects of a specific type with any relation](#2-a-particular-user-to-any-objects-of-a-specific-type-with-any-relation)
3. [a particular object to any user with a particular relation](#3-a-particular-object-to-any-user-with-a-particular-relation)

#### 1. A particular user to any objects of a specific type with a particular relation

For example, to query all the stored relationship tuples `bob` has a `writer` relationship with, one can ask

<ReadRequestViewer
  user={'user:bob'}
  relation={'writer'}
  object={'document:'}
  tuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:bob',
      relation: 'writer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

#### 2. A particular user to any objects of a specific type with any relation

For example, to query all the stored relationship tuples in which `bob` is related to objects of type `document` as any relation, one can issue the following call:

<ReadRequestViewer
  user={'user:bob'}
  object={'document:'}
  tuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:bob',
      relation: 'writer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

#### 3. A particular object to any user with a particular relation

For example, to query all the stored relationship tuples in which any user is related to `document:planning` as a `writer`, one can issue the following call:

<ReadRequestViewer
  relation={'writer'}
  object={'document:planning'}
  tuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:bob',
      relation: 'writer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

### Caveats and when not to use it

The Read API will only return all the stored relationships that match the query specification.
It does not expand or traverse the graph by taking the authorization model into account.

For example, if you specify that `writers` are `viewers` in the authorization model, the Read API will ignore that and it will return tuples where a user is a `viewer` if and only if the `(user_id, "viewer", object_type:object_id)` relationship tuple exists in the system.

In the following case, although all `writers` have reader `relationships` for document objects and `bob` is a `writer` for `document:planning`, if you query for all objects that `bob` has `reader` relationships, it will not return `document:planning`.

<ReadRequestViewer user={'user:bob'} relation={'reader'} object={'document:'} tuples={[]} />

:::info
Although bob is a writer to document:planning and every writer is also a reader, the Read API will return an empty list because there are no stored relationship tuples that relate bob to document:planning as reader.
:::

## Expand

### What is it for?

The [Expand API](/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Expand) returns all users (including users and usersets) that have a specific relationship with an object.
The response is represented as a tree of users or usersets. To build the full graph of access, you would need to recursively call expand on the leaves returned from the previous expand call.

### When to use?

Expand is used for debugging and to understand why a user has a particular relationship with a specific object.

For example, to understand why `bob` can have a `reader` relationship with `document:planning`, one could first call

<ExpandRequestViewer relation={'reader'} object={'document:planning'} />

The result of this call will be like

```json
{
  "tree":{
    "root":{
      "type":"document:planning#reader",
        "leaf":{
          "computed":{
            "userset":"document:planning#writer"
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The returned tree will contain `writer`, for which we will call

<ExpandRequestViewer relation={'writer'} object={'document:planning'} />

The result of this call will be like

```json
{
  "tree":{
    "root":{
      "type":"document:planning#writer",
        "leaf":{
          "users":{
            "users":[
              "user:bob"
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

From there, we will learn that

- those related to `document:planning` as `reader` are all those who are related to that document as `writer`
- `bob` is related to `document:planning` as `writer`

## ListObjects

### What is it for?

The [ListObjects API](/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects) is an API endpoint that returns the list of all the objects of a particular type that a specific user has a specific relationship with.

It provides a solution to the [Search with Permissions (Option 3)](./search-with-permissions.mdx#option-3-build-a-list-of-ids-then-search) use case for access-aware filtering on small object collections.

### When to use?

Use the ListObjects API to get what objects a user can see based on the relationships they have. See [Search with Permissions](./search-with-permissions.mdx) for more guidance.

<ListObjectsRequestViewer
  authorizationModelId="01HVMMBCMGZNT3SED4Z17ECXCA"
  objectType="document"
  relation="reader"
  user="user:bob"
  contextualTuples={[{ object: 'document:otherdoc', relation: 'reader', user: 'user:bob' }]}
  expectedResults={['document:otherdoc', 'document:planning']}
/>

There's two variations of the List Objects API.

- The [standard version](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects), which waits until all results are ready and sends them in one response.
- The [streaming version](/api/service#Relationship%20Queries/StreamedListObjects), which should be used if you want the individual results as soon as they become available.

### Caveats

ListObjects will return the results found within the time allotted (`listObjectsDeadline`, default: `3s`) up to the maximum number of results configured (`listObjectsMaxResults`, default: `1000`). See [Configuring the Server](../getting-started/setup-openfga/configure-openfga.mdx)) for more on how to change the default configuration.

- If you set `listObjectsDeadline` to `1s`, the server will spend at most 1 second finding results.
- If you set `listObjectsMaxResults` to `10`, the server will return, at most, 10 objects.

If the number of objects of that type is high, you should set a high value for `listObjectsDeadline`. If the number of objects of that type the user could have access to is high, you should set a high value for `listObjectsMaxResults`.

## ListUsers

### What is it for?

The [ListUsers API](/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListUsers) is an API endpoint that that returns all users of a given type that have a specified relationship with an object.

### When to use?

Use the ListUsers API to get which users have a relation to a specific object. 

<ListUsersRequestViewer
  authorizationModelId="01HVMMBCMGZNT3SED4Z17ECXCA"
  objectType="document"
  objectId="planning"
  relation="viewer"
  userFilterType="user"
  expectedResults={{
    users: [
      { object: { type: "user", id: "anne" }}, 
      { object: { type: "user", id: "beth" }}
    ]
  }}
/>

### Caveats

ListUsers will return the results found within the time allotted (`listUsersDeadline`, default: `3s`) up to the maximum number of results configured (`listUsersMaxResults`, default: `1000`). See [Configuring the Server](../getting-started/setup-openfga/configure-openfga.mdx)) for more on how to change the default configuration.

- If you set `listUsersDeadline` to `1s`, the server will spend at most 1 second finding results.
- If you set `listUsersMaxResults` to `10`, the server will return, at most, 10 objects.

If the number of users matching that filter is high, you should set a high value for `listUsersDeadline`. If the number of users matching that filter that could have that relation with the object is high, you should set a high value for `listUsersMaxResults`.
