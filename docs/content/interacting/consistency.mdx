# Query Consistency Modes

<DocumentationNotice />

:::info Note
The Consistency parameter is an experimental feature in OpenFGA ([v1.5.7](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.5.7)+) and needs to be enabled with the `enable-consistency-params` parameter, e.g. `openfga run --experimentals enable-consistency-params`.
:::

## Background

When querying <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> using Read or any of the query APIs like [Check, Expand, ListObjects and ListUsers](./relationship-queries.mdx), you can specify a query consistency parameter that can have one of the following values:

| Name                        | Description                                                                                                   |  
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| MINIMIZE_LATENCY (default)  | <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> will serve queries from the cache when possible           | 
| HIGHER_CONSISTENCY          | <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> will skip the cache and query the the database directly   |

If you write a tuple and you immediately make a check on a relation affected by that tuple using `MINIMIZE_LATENCY`, the tuple change might not be taken in consideration if <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> serves the result from the cache.

## When to use higher consistency

When specifying `HIGHER_CONSISTENCY` you are trading off consistency for latency and system performance. Always specifying `HIGHER_CONSISTENCY` will have a significant impact in performance.

If you have a use case where higher consistency is needed, it's recommended that whenever possible, you decide in runtime the consistency level you need. If you are storing a timestamp indicating when a resource was last modified in your database, you can use that to decide the kind of request you do.

For example, if you share `document:readme` with a `user:anne` and you update a `modified_date` field in the `document` table when that happens, you can write code like the below when calling `check("user:anne", "can_view", "document:readme")` to avoid paying the price of additional latency when calling the API.

```javascript
if (date_modified + cache_time_to_live_period > Date.now()) {
    const { allowed } = await fgaClient.check(
      { user: "user:anne", relation: "can_view", object: "document:roadmap"}
    );
} else {
    const { allowed } = await fgaClient.check(
        {  user: "user:anne", relation: "can_view", object: "document:roadmap"},
        {  consistency: ConsistencyPreference.HigherConsistency }
    );
}
```

## Cache expiration

<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> cache is disabled by default. When not enabled, all queries will have strong consistency regardless of the consistency mode specified.

You can use the following parameters to configure <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>'s cache:

| Name                    | Description                                                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| check-query-cache       | Enables caching (default = false)                                               | 
| check-query-cache-limit | Configures the number of items that will be kept in the cache (default = 10000) | 
| check-query-cache-ttl   | Specifies the time that items will be kept in the cache (default = 10s)         |	

Learn how to [configure <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>](../getting-started/setup-openfga/configure-openfga.mdx).

Currently, the cache is used by Check and partially in ListObjects. It will be implemented it for other query endpoints in the future.

## Future work

The <IntroductionSection linkName="Zanzibar paper" section="what-is-zanzibar"/> has a feature called `Zookies`, which is a consistency token that is returned from Write operation. You can store that token in you resource table, and specify it in subsequent calls to query APIs. 

<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> is considering a similar feature in future releases.
