# Managing User Access

<DocumentationNotice />

In this guide you will learn how to grant a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="user" /> access to a particular <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="object" />.

<CardBox title="When to use" appearance="filled" description=<div>

Granting access with a _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="relationship tuple" />_ is a core part of <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>. Without any relationship tuples, any _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-check-request" linkName="check" />_ will fail. You should use:

- _authorization model_ to represent what **relation**s are possible between the users and objects in your system
- _relationship tuples_ to represent the facts about the relationships between users and objects in your system.

</div> />

## Before You Start

In order to understand this guide correctly you must be familiar with some <ProductConcept /> and know how to develop the things that we will list below.

<details>
<summary>

Assume that you have the following <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" />.<br />
You have a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="type" /> called `tweet` that can have a `reader`.

</summary>

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'tweet',
        relations: {
          reader: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            reader: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

In addition, you will need to know the following:

### Direct Access

You need to know how to create an authorization model and create a relationship tuple to grant a user access to an object. [Learn more â†’](../modeling/direct-access.mdx)

### <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> Concepts

- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="Type" />: a class of objects that have similar characteristics
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="User" />: an entity in the system that can be related to an object
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system
- An <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="Object" />: represents an entity in the system. Users' relationships to it can be define through relationship tuples and the authorization model
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" />: a grouping consisting of a user, a relation and an object stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>

</details>

## Step By Step

### 01. Adding Direct Relationship

For our application, we will give user Anne the `reader` relationship to a particular `tweet`. To do so we add a tuple as follows:

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: 'Anne can read tweet:1',
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'reader',
      object: 'tweet:1',
    },
  ]}
/>

With the above, we have added a [**direct** relationship](../modeling/building-blocks/direct-relationships.mdx) between Anne and `tweet:1`. When we call the Check API to see if Anne has a `reader` relationship, <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> will say yes.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:anne'} relation={'reader'} object={'tweet:1'} allowed={true} />

### 02. Removing Direct Relationship

Now let's change this so that Anne no longer has a `reader` relationship to `tweet:1` by deleting the tuple:

<WriteRequestViewer
  deleteRelationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'reader',
      object: 'tweet:1',
    },
  ]}
/>

With this, we have removed the [direct relationship](../modeling/building-blocks/direct-relationships.mdx) between Anne and `tweet:1`. And because our type definition for `reader` does not include any other relations, a call to the Check API will now return a negative response.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:anne'} relation={'reader'} object={'tweet:1'} allowed={false} />
