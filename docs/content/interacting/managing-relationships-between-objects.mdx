# Managing Relationships Between Objects

<DocumentationNotice />

In this guide you will learn how to grant a user access to a particular object through a relationship with another object.

<CardBox title="When to use" appearance="filled" description={<div>

Giving user access through a relationship with another object is helpful because it allows scaling as the number of object grows. For example:

- organization that owns many repos
- team that administers many documents

</div>} />

## Before you start

In order to understand this guide correctly you must be familiar with some <ProductConcept /> and know how to develop the things that we will list below.

<details>
<summary>

Assume that you have the following <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" /><br />

- a `repo` type that can have a `admin` relation

</summary>

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'repo',
        relations: {
          admin: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            admin: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

In addition, you will need to know the following:

### Direct Access

You need to know how to create an authorization model and create a relationship tuple to grant a user access to an object. [Learn more â†’](../modeling/direct-access.mdx)

### <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> Concepts

- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="Type" />: a class of objects that have similar characteristics
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="User" />: an entity in the system that can be related to an object
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system
- An <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="Object" />: represents an entity in the system. Users' relationships to it can be define through relationship tuples and the authorization model
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" />: a grouping consisting of a user, a relation and an object stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>

</details>

## Step By Step

For the current model, a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="user" /> can be related as an `admin` to an <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="object" /> of <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="type" /> `repo`. If we wanted to have Anne be related to two repos, `repo:1` and `repo:2`, we would have to add two <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="relationship tuples" />, like so:

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'admin',
      object: 'repo:1',
    },
    {
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'admin',
      object: 'repo:2',
    },
  ]}
/>

In general, every time we wanted to add a new `admin` relationship to a `repo` we'd have to add a new tuple. This doesn't scale as the list of `repo`s and users grows.

### 01. Modify Authorization Model

Another way of modeling this is to have an authorization model as follows:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'repo',
        relations: {
          admin: {
            union: {
              child: [
                {
                  this: {},
                },
                {
                  tupleToUserset: {
                    tupleset: {
                      object: '',
                      relation: 'owner',
                    },
                    computedUserset: {
                      object: '',
                      relation: 'repo_admin',
                    },
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
          owner: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'org' }] },
            admin: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'org',
        relations: {
          repo_admin: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            repo_admin: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

In this model, we have:

- added a new type `org` with one relation `repo_admin`.
- added a new relation `owner` for type `repo`.
- re-defined the relation `admin` for `repo`. A user can be defined as an `admin` directly, as we have seen above, or through the `repo_admin from owner` clause. How this works, for example, is that if `user` is related as `repo_admin` to `org:xyz`, and `org:xyz` is related as `owner` to `repo:1`, then `user` is an `admin` of `repo:1`.

### 02. Adding Relationship Tuples Where User Is Another Object

With this model, we can add tuples representing that an `org` is the `owner` of a `repo`. By adding following relationship tuples, we are indicating that the xyz organization is the owner of repositories with IDs `1` and `2`:

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'org:xyz',
      relation: 'owner',
      object: 'repo:1',
    },
    {
      user: 'org:xyz',
      relation: 'owner',
      object: 'repo:2',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 03. Adding Relationship Tuples To The Other Object

Now, imagine we have a new user Becky. If we wanted to have Becky be the `admin` of all `repo`s without having to add one tuple per `repo`, all we need to do is add one tuple that says that Becky is related as `repo_admin` to `org:xyz`.

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:becky',
      relation: 'repo_admin',
      object: 'org:xyz',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 04. Validating User Access

We can now verify that Becky an `admin` of all the `repo`s owned by `org:xyz`:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:becky'} relation={'admin'} object={'repo:1'} allowed={true} />

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:becky'} relation={'admin'} object={'repo:2'} allowed={true} />

### 05. Revoking Access

Suppose now that we want to prevent users from being an `admin` of `repo:1` via `org:xyz`. We can delete one tuple:

<WriteRequestViewer
  deleteRelationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'org:xyz',
      relation: 'owner',
      object: 'repo:1',
    },
  ]}
/>

With this change, we may now verify that Becky is no longer an `admin` of `repo:1`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:becky'} relation={'admin'} object={'repo:1'} allowed={false} />
