# Roles and Permissions

<DocumentationNotice />

To model roles and permissions in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ProductLink}/> using <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization models" /> and <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="relationship tuples" />. For the purpose of this guide:

- **Roles** are assigned to <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="users" /> or groups of users, where any user can have more than one role, like `editor` or `owner`.
- **Permissions** allow users to access certain <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="objects" /> based on their specific roles, like `device_renamer` or `channel_archiver`.

For example, the role `viewer` of a `trip` can have permissions to view bookings, while the role `owners` has permissions to add or view bookings to a trip.

<CardBox title="When to use" appearance="filled">

When creating a role and permissions model within <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>, you should:

- Create roles by creating relations that can be directly assigned to users.
- Assign permissions by creating relations that users get through other relations.

For example:

- Grant someone an `admin` role that can `edit` and `read` a `document`
- Grant someone a `security_guard` role that can `live_video_viewer` on a `device`
- Grant someone a `viewer` role that can `view_products` on a `shop`

There are advantages to implementing roles and permissions within <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>, such as:

- Breaking down existing roles to have more fine grained permission, which enables your application to check whether a user has access to a certain object without having to explicitly check that specific user's role.
- Introduce new roles/permissions or consolidate roles without affecting your application behavior. For example: if your app's checks are for the fine permissions `check('bob', 'booking_adder', 'trip:Europe')` instead of `check('bob', 'owner', 'trip:Europe')`, and you later decide `owners` can no longer add bookings to a `trip`, you can remove the relation within the `trip` type with no code changes in your application, and all the permissions will automatically honor the change.

## Before you start

Familiarize yourself with the <ProductConcept />.

<details>
<summary>

Assume you have the following <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" /><br /> and that you have a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="type" /> called `trip` that users can be related to as `viewer` and/or as an `owner`.

</summary>

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'trip',
        relations: {
          owner: {
            this: {},
          },
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}

### Direct Access

Learn how to create an authorization model and create a relationship tuple to grant a user access to an object. For more information, see [Direct Access.](./direct-access.mdx)

### <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> Concepts

- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="Type" />: a class of objects that have similar characteristics
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="User" />: an entity in the system that can be related to an object
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system
- An <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="Object" />: represents an entity in the system. Users' relationships to it can be define through relationship tuples and the authorization model
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" />: a group consisting of a user, a relation, and an object stored in Auth <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship" linkName="Relationship" />: <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> will be called to check if there is a relationship between a user and an object, indicating that the access is allowed
- [Direct Relationship Type Restrictions](../configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions): can be used to indicate direct relationships between users and objects
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-check-request" linkName="Check API Request" />: used to check for relationships between users and objects

## Step By Step

To illustrate modeling Roles and Permissions in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>, imagine a trip booking system that has `owners` and/or `viewers`. It can also have granular permissions like adding bookings or viewing bookings on a trip.

To represent this, you need to:

1. Understand how roles are related to direct relations for the trip booking system
2. Add implied relations to the existing authorization model to define permissions for bookings
3. <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-check-request" linkName="Check" /> user roles and their permissions based on relationship
   tuples for direct and implied relations

### 01. Understand How Roles Work Within Our Trip Booking System

In <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>, roles are relations that can be directly assigned to users. In this authorization model, your roles are `owner` and `viewer`, so a specific user can be an `owner` and/or a `viewer`.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'trip',
        relations: {
          // Users can have role: 'owner'
          owner: {
            this: {},
          },
          // Users can have role: 'viewer'
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

### 02. Add Permissions For Bookings

In <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/>, permissions are relations that users get only through other relations. To represent permissions, define the relation by other relations to indicate that it is a permission both granted to and implied from a different relation. Doing so avoids adding a [direct relationship type restriction](../configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions) to the relation in the authorization model.

To add permissions related to bookings, add new relations to the `trip` object type denoting the various actions a user can take on `trips`, like view, edit, or delete.

To allow `viewers` of a `trip` to view bookings and `owners` to add/view bookings, modify the type as seen below:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'trip',
        relations: {
          // User Roles: `owner` and `viewer`
          owner: {
            this: {},
          },
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
          // Permission `booking_adder`
          booking_adder: {
            // Users with role: `owner` can add bookings
            computedUserset: {
              relation: 'owner',
            },
          },
          // Permission `booking_viewer`
          booking_viewer: {
            union: {
              child: [
                {
                  // Users with role: `viewer` can view bookings
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'viewer',
                  },
                },
                {
                  // Users with role: `owner` can view bookings
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'owner',
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

> Note: Both `booking_viewer` and `booking_adder` don't have [direct relationship type restrictions](../configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions). This ensures that the relation can only be assigned through the role and not directly.

### 03. Checking User Roles And Their Permissions

Now that your type definitions reflect the roles and permissions governing how bookings can be viewed and added, create <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="relationship tuples" /> to assign roles to users, then *<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-check-request" linkName="check" />* if users have the proper permissions.

Create two relationship tuples:

1. gives `bob` the role of `viewer` on `trip:Europe`.
2. gives `alice` the role of `owner` on `trip:Europe`.

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: 'Add bob as viewer on trip:Europe',
      user: 'user:bob',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'trip:Europe',
    },
    {
      _description: 'Add alice as owner on trip:Europe',
      user: 'user:alice',
      relation: 'owner',
      object: 'trip:Europe',
    },
  ]}
/>

Now check: `is bob allowed to view bookings on trip Europe?`

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:bob'} relation={'booking_viewer'} object={'trip:Europe'} allowed={true} />

`bob` is a `booking_viewer` because of the following chain of resolution:

1. `bob` is a `viewer` on `trip:Europe`
2. Any user related to the object `trip:Europe` as `viewer` is also related as a `booking_viewer` (i.e `usersRelatedToObjectAs: viewer`)
3. Therefore, all `viewers` on a given `trip` are `booking_viewers`

To confirm that `bob` is not allowed to add bookings on trip `Europe`, perform the following check:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:bob'} relation={'booking_adder'} object={'trip:Europe'} allowed={false} />

You can also check: is `alice` allowed to view and add bookings on trip `Europe`?

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:alice'} relation={'booking_viewer'} object={'trip:Europe'} allowed={true} />
<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:alice'} relation={'booking_adder'} object={'trip:Europe'} allowed={true} />

`alice` is a `booking_viewer` and `booking_adder` because of the following chain of resolution:

1. `alice` is a `owner` on `trip:Europe`
2. Any user related to the _object_ `trip:` `Europe` as `owner` is also related as a `booking_viewer`
3. Any user related to the _object_ `trip:` `Europe` as `owner` is also related as a `booking_adder`
4. Therefore, all `owners` on a given `trip` are `booking_viewers` and `booking_adders` on that trip

:::caution
Note: Use unique IDs for each object and user within your application domain when creating relationship tuples for <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/>. This guide uses first names and simple IDs as an easy-to-follow example.
