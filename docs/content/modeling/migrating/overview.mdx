This section has guides that focus on migrating models and relations.

You can think of model migrations for <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>  in the same way as you think about relational database migrations. You can perform migrations with or without downtime for both, and for some changes, doing them without downtime is harder.

|-----------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| Add a type                                          | Add a table           |
| Remove a type                                       | Remove a table        |
| Rename a type                                       | Rename a table        |
| Add a relation                                      | Add a nullable column |
| Rename a relation                                   | Rename a column       |
| Delete a relation                                   | Delete a column       |

When thinking about migrations, keep in mind that:

- [Models are immutable](../../getting-started/immutable-models.mdx).
- The tuples that are not valid according to the specified model, are ignored when evaluating queries. 

## To add a type or relation

  1. Add the type or relation to the authorization model, and write the model to the store. This will generate a new model ID.
  2. If you have tuples to write for the new types/relations, write them.
  3. Update the application code to start using those new types/relations.
  4. Configure the application to start using the new model ID.

## To delete a type or relation

  1. Delete the type or relation to the authorization model, and write the model to the store. This will generate a new model ID.
  2. Update the application code to stops using the deleted types/relations.
  3. Configure the application to start using the new model ID.
  4. Delete the tuples for the deleted type/relations. While not required, doing so can improve performance. Invalid tuples will be ignored during query evaluation, but their presence may slow down the process if they need to be retrieved.

## To rename a type or relation

  - [This document](./migrating-relations.mdx) describes an end-to-end example for that use case.
