# Concentric Relationships

<DocumentationNotice />

In this short guide, you'll learn how to represent a concentric <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship" linkName="relationships" />.

For example, if you want to have all editors of a document also be viewers of said document.

<CardBox title="When to use" appearance="filled" description={<div>

Concentric relations make the most sense when your domain logic has nested relations, where one having relation implies having another relation.

For example:

- all `editors` are `viewers`
- all `managers` are `members`
- all `device_managers` are `device_renamers`

This allows you to only create a single _relationship tuple_ rather than creating n _relationship tuples_ for each relation.

</div>} />

## Before You Start

To better understand this guide, you should be familiar with some <ProductConcept /> and know how to develop the things listed below.

<details>
<summary>

You will start with the _<ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" />_ below, it represents a `document` _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="type" />_ that can have users **<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="related" />** as `editor` and `viewer`.

Let us also assume that we have a `document` called "meeting_notes.doc" and bob is assigned as editor to this document.

</summary>

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            this: {},
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{type: 'user'}] },
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{type: 'user'}] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

The current state of the system is represented by the following relationship tuples being in the system already:

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:bob',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:meeting_notes.doc',
    },
  ]}
/>

In addition, you will need to know the following:

### Modeling User Groups

You need to know how to add users to groups and grant groups access to resources. [Learn more â†’](../user-groups.mdx)

### <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> Concepts

- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="Type" />: a class of objects that have similar characteristics
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="User" />: an entity in the system that can be related to an object
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system
- An <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="Object" />: represents an entity in the system. Users' relationships to it can be define through relationship tuples and the authorization model
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" />: a grouping consisting of a user, a relation and an object stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>

</details>

<Playground />

## Step By Step

With the current type definition, there isn't a way to indicate that all `editors` of a certain `document` are also automatically `viewers` of that document. So for a certain user, in order to indicate that they can both `edit` and `view` a certain `document`, two _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="relationship tuples" />_ need to be created (one for `editor`, and another for `viewer`).

### 01. Modify Our Model To Imply Editor As Viewer

Instead of creating two _relationship tuples_, we can leverage concentric relationships by defining editors are viewers.

Our authorization model becomes the following:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            union: {
              child: [
                {
                  // a user can be assigned a direct `viewer` relation, i.e., not implied through another relation
                  this: {},
                },
                {
                  // a user that is an editor is also implicitly a viewer
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'editor',
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{type: 'user'}] },
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{type: 'user'}] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

:::info

`viewer` of a `document` are any of:

1. users that are directly assigned as `viewer`
2. users that have `editor` of the document

:::

With this authorization model change, having an `editor` relationship with a certain document implies having a `viewer` relationship with that same document.

### 02. Check That Editors Are Viewers

Since we had a _relationship tuple_ that indicates that **bob** is an `editor` of **document:meeting_notes.doc**, this means **bob** is now implicitly a `viewer` of **document:meeting_notes.doc**.
If we now check: **is bob a viewer of document:meeting_notes.doc?** we would get the following:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:bob'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:meeting_notes.doc'} allowed={true} />

:::caution Note
When creating relationship tuples for <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> make sure to use unique ids for each object and user within your application domain. We're using first names and simple ids to just illustrate an easy-to-follow example.
