# Direct Relationships

<DocumentationNotice />

In this guide you'll learn how to model relationships that may or may not be assigned directly to individual users.

<CardBox title="When to use" appearance="filled" description=<div>

Disabling _direct relationships_ for a certain relation on an objects are useful especially in cases where you are trying to model some permissions that are not usually granted individually to a user.

This is useful when:

- For security reason, not permitting permissions assigned directly to individuals without associating roles

</div> />

## Before you start

To better understand this guide, you should be familiar with some <ProductConcept /> and know how to develop the things listed below.

<details>

<summary>

You will need to know the following:

- Modeling Basics
- <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm} /> Concepts

</summary>

### Modeling Basics

You need to know how to create an authorization model and create a relationship tuple to grant a user access to an object. [Learn more →](../basics/modeling-basics.mdx)

### <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> Concepts

- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="Type" />: a class of objects that have similar characteristics
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="User" />: an entity in the system that can be related to an object
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: is a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between objects of this type and other users in the system
- An <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="Object" />: represents an entity in the system. Users' relationships to it can be define through relationship tuples and the authorization model
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" />: a grouping consisting of a user, a relation and an object stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>
- [Direct Relationship Keyword](../configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-keyword): `self` used in the context of the relation definition can be used to allow direct relationships to the objects of this type

</details>

## What are direct relationships?

Direct relationships are relationships where a user has a relationship to an <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="object" /> that is not dependent on any other relationship they have with that object.

When checking for a relationship, a direct relationship exists if a _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="relationship tuple" />_ is present in the system with the exact same object and relation that were in the query and where the user is one of:

- the same user ID as that in the query
- everyone (`*`)
- a set of users that contains the user ID present in the query

## Enable or disable direct relationships

Direct relationships can be enabled for a specific relation on an _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="object type" />_ by adding the [direct relationship keyword](../configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-keyword) from that <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation-definition" linkName="relation's definition" />. Likewise, they can be disabled by removing that keyword.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            union: {
              child: [
                {
                  // a user can be assigned a direct `viewer` relation, i.e., not implied through another relation
                  this: {},
                },
                {
                  // a user who is related as an editor is also implicitly related as a viewer
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'editor',
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'team',
        relations: {
          member: {

        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

:::info

The <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" /> describes two <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="object types" />: `document` and `team`.

The `document` <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type-definition" linkName="type definition" /> has two <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="relations" />, `editor` and `viewer`. Both relations allow a direct relationship; `viewer` also allows an <ProductConcept section="what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships" linkName="indirect relationship" /> through `editor`.

In the `team` type definition, there is a single `member` relation that only allows direct relationships.

:::

## How it affects your system

To illustrate the effect enabling or disabling direct relationships on a specific relation has, we'll investigate several situations.

### 1. With direct relationships enabled

Let us start with the authorization model we had above:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            union: {
              child: [
                {
                  // a user can be assigned a direct `viewer` relation, i.e., not implied through another relation
                  this: {},
                },
                {
                  // a user who is related as an editor is also implicitly related as a viewer
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'editor',
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'team',
        relations: {
          member: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

Now choose the type of relation to see how it affects your system:

<Tabs groupId='relationship-type'>
<TabItem value='direct' label='Direct User'>

Assume you have a tuple that states that Anne is a `viewer` of `document:planning`

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'anne',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

Now if we do a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-check-request" linkName="check request" /> to see if Anne can view the planning document, we will get a response of `{"allowed": true}`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'anne'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={true} />

This is because:

- There is a relationship tuple specifying that Anne has a `viewer` relationship with `document:planning`.
- Direct relationships are allowed in the `viewer` relation definition in the `document` type definition.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='everyone' label='Everyone'>

Assume you have a tuple that states that <ProductConcept section="how-do-i-represent-everyone" linkName="everyone" /> is a `viewer` of `document:planning` (In other words, the document is public)

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: '*',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

Now if we do a check request to see if Beth can view the planning document, we will get a response of `{"allowed": true}`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'beth'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={true} />

This is because:

- There is a relationship tuple specifying that everyone has a `viewer` relationship with `document:planning`.
- Direct relationships are allowed in the `viewer` relation definition in the `document` type definition.

:::info

Note: Even though the relationship tuple stored in the system does not specify the user (`beth`), this is still considered a direct relationship.

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='userset' label='Userset'>

[_Usersets_](../../modeling/concepts/usersets.mdx) are the third way direct relationships apply, we will see how in this section.

Assume you have two relationship tuples:

- Charlie is a member of the product team.
- Members of the product team are viewers of the planning document.

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'charlie',
      relation: 'member',
      object: 'team:product',
    },
    {
      user: 'team:product#member',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

:::info

Note that these two relationship tuples are specifying that:

- `charlie` is a `member` of `team:product`.
- any `member` of `team:product` is a `viewer` of `document:planning`.
  - Note that this second relationship tuple is specifying that the **members** of the team have viewer access, and not the team object itself.

:::

Now if we do a _check request_ to see if charlie can view the planning document, we will get a response of `{"allowed": true}`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'charlie'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={true} />

This is because:

- Charlie is a member of the product team.
- There is a relationship tuple specifying that all members of the product team have a `viewer` relationship with `document:planning`.
- Direct relationships are allowed in the `viewer` relation definition in the `document` type definition.

Note that this is still considered a direct relationship no matter how many resolutions occur on the usersets until the user is found.

For example, if our relationship tuples were the following relationship tuples:

- Dany is a member of the product leads team.
- Members of the product leads team are members of the product team.
- Members of the product team are members of the contoso team.
- Members of the contoso team are viewers of the planning document.

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'dany',
      relation: 'member',
      object: 'team:product-leads',
    },
    {
      user: 'team:product-leads#member',
      relation: 'member',
      object: 'team:product',
    },
    {
      user: 'team:product#member',
      relation: 'member',
      object: 'team:contoso',
    },
    {
      user: 'team:contoso#member',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

A subsequent _check request_ to see if Dany can view the planning document will still return a response of `{"allowed": true}`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'dany'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={true} />

:::info

Note: Even though the relationship tuple stored in the system does not specify the user (`charlie` or `dany`), this is still considered a direct relationship.

:::

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='indirect' label='Indirect Relationship'>

Here we will cover one example of an <ProductConcept section="what-are-direct-and-implied-relationships" linkName="indirect relationship" /> in order to see how they differ from direct relationships.

With the same authorization model we have above, assume there is a relationship tuple that specifies that Emily is an `editor` of `document:planning`.

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'emily',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

A subsequent _check request_ to see if emily can view the planning document will still return a response of `{"allowed": true}`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'emily'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={true} />

This is because:

- Emily is an `editor` of the planning document.
- The authorization model specified that anyone who is an `editor` on a `document` is also a `viewer` on that document.

In this case, there is **NO** direct viewer relationship between Emily and the planning document. The only viewer relationship that exists is implied because Emily is an editor and the authorization model specified that any document's `editor` is that document's viewer.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### 2. With direct relationships disabled

In this section, we will investigate the effect of disabling _direct relationships_ on the document's `viewer` relation.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            // a user who is related as an editor is also implicitly related as a viewer
            computedUserset: {
              relation: 'editor',
            },
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'team',
        relations: {
          member: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

:::info

Notice that in this updated authorization model, the direct relationship keyword has been removed from the document's `viewer` relation definition.

:::

Now choose the type of relation to see how it affects your system:

<Tabs groupId='relationship-type'>
<TabItem value='direct' label='Direct User'>

Assume you have a tuple that states that Fred is a `viewer` of `document:planning`

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'fred',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

Now if we do a check request to see if Fred can view the planning document, we will get a response of `{"allowed": false}`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'fred'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={false} />

This is because:

- Even though there is a relationship tuple specifying that Fred has a `viewer` relationship with `document:planning`.
- Direct relationships are **NOT** allowed in the `viewer` relation definition in the `document` type definition.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='everyone' label='Everyone'>

You will see the same behaviour with a relationship tuple specifying everyone as the user.

Assume you have a tuple that states that everyone is a `viewer` of `document:planning`.

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: '*',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

Now if we do a check request to see if Gabriel can view the planning document, we will get a response of `{"allowed": false}`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'gabriel'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={false} />

This is because:

- Even though there is a relationship tuple specifying that everyone has a `viewer` relationship with `document:planning`.
- Direct relationships are **NOT** allowed in the `viewer` relation definition in the `document` type definition.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='userset' label='Userset'>

The same logic applies to usersets.

Assume you have two relationship tuples:

- Henry is a member of the product team.
- Members of the product team are viewers of the planning document.

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'henry',
      relation: 'member',
      object: 'team:product',
    },
    {
      user: 'team:product#member',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

Now if we do a check request to see if Henry can view the planning document, we will get a response of `{"allowed": false}`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'henry'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={false} />

This is because although:

- Henry is a member of the product team.
- There is a relationship tuple specifying that all members of the product team have a `viewer` relationship with `document:planning`.

Direct relationships are **NOT** allowed in the `viewer` relation definition in the `document` type definition.

</TabItem>

<TabItem value='indirect' label='Indirect Relationship'>

Indirect relationships are not affected by disabling a direct relationship on a certain relation.

Assume there is a relationship tuple that specifies that Ingred is an `editor` of `document:planning`.

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'ingred',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:planning',
    },
  ]}
/>

A subsequent check request to see if Ingred can view the planning document will still return a response of `{"allowed": true}`.

<CheckRequestViewer user={'ingred'} relation={'viewer'} object={'document:planning'} allowed={true} />

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
