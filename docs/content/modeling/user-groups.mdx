# User Groups

<DocumentationNotice />

To add users to groups and grant groups access to an <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="object" /> using <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ProductLink}/>.

<CardBox title="When to use" appearance="filled">

Relationship tuples can specify that an entire group has a relation to an object, which is helpful when you want to encompass a set of users with the same relation to an object. For example:

- Grant `viewer` access to a group of `engineers` in `roadmap.doc`
- Create a `block_list` of `members` who can't access a `document`
- Sharing a `document` with a `team`
- Granting `viewer` access to a `photo` to `followers` only
- Making a `file` viewable for all `users` within an `organization`
- Restricting access from or to `users` in a certain `locale`

</CardBox>

## Before you start

Familiarize yourself with the <ProductConcept />.

<details>
<summary>

Assume you have the following <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" />.<br />: you have an _<ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="object" />_ called `document` that users can relate to as an `editor`.

</summary>

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

### Direct Access

You need to know how to create an authorization model and a relationship tuple to grant a user access to an object. To learn more, see [direct access](./direct-access.mdx).

### <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> Concepts

- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="Type" />: a class of objects that have similar characteristics.
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="User" />: an entity in the system that can be related to an object.
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="Relation" />: a string defined in the type definition of an authorization model that defines the possibility of a relationship between an object of the same type as the type definition and a user in the system.
- An <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="Object" />: represents an entity in the system. Users' relationships to it can be defined with relationship tuples and the authorization model.
- A <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="Relationship Tuple" />: a grouping consisting of a user, a relation and an object stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>.

## Step By Step

There are possible use cases where a group of users have a certain role on or permission to an object. For example, `members` of a certain `team` could have an `editor` relation to a certain `document`.

To represent this in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>:

1. Introduce the concept of a `team` to the authorization model. [→](#step-1)
2. Add users as `members` to the `team`. [→](#step-2)
3. Assign the `team` members a relation to an object. [→](#step-3)
4. Check an individual member's access to the object. [→](#step-4)

### 01. Introduce the concept of a team to the authorization model {#step-1}

First, define the _<ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="object" />_ `team` in your authorization model. In this use case, a `team` can have `member`s, so you make the following changes to the authorization model:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'team', relation: 'member' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'team',
        relations: {
          member: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            member: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

### 02. Add users as members to the team {#step-2}

You can now assign _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="users" />_ as `member`s of `team`s. Create a new _<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relationship-tuple" linkName="relationship tuple" />_ that states `user:alice` is a member of `team:writers`.

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'user:alice',
      relation: 'member',
      object: 'team:writers',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 03. Assign the team members a relation to an object {#step-3}

To represent groups, use the `type:object_id#relation` format, which represents the set of users related to the `type:object_id` as a certain relation. For example, `team:writers#members` represents the set of users related to the `team:writers` object as `member`s.

In order to assign `member`s of a `team` a relation to a `document`, create the following relationship tuple stating that members of `team:writers` are editors of `document:meeting_notes.doc`.

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: "Set of users related to 'team:writers' as 'member'",
      user: 'team:writers#member',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:meeting_notes.doc',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 04. Check an individual member's access to an object {#step-4}

Now that you have:

- a relationship tuple indicating that `alice` is a `member` of `team:writers`
- a relationship tuple indicating that `members` of `team:writers` are editors of `document:meeting_notes.doc`

The \*<ProductConcept section="what-is-a-check-request" linkName="check" />\ `is alice an editor of document:meeting_notes.doc` returns the following:

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:alice'} relation={'editor'} object={'document:meeting_notes.doc'} allowed={true} />

The chain of resolution is:

- `alice` is `member` of `team:writers`
- `member`s of `team:writers` are `editor`s of `document:meeting_notes`  
- therefore, `alice` is `editor` of `document:meeting_notes`

:::caution

**Note:** When creating relationship tuples for <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>,  use unique ids for each object and user in your application domain. This example uses first names and simple ids as a suggested example.
