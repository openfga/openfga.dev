# Custom Roles

<DocumentationNotice />

In this guide you'll learn how to model custom roles in your system using <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ProductLink}/>.

For example, a Business-to-Business (B2B) application could allow customers to create their own custom roles on the application to grant their users.

<CardBox title="When to use" appearance="filled">

In many cases, roles would fit in well as relations on an object type, as seen in [Modeling Roles and Permissions](./roles-and-permissions.mdx). In some cases, however, they may not be enough.

Custom roles are useful when:

- Users of the application are able to create arbitrary sets of roles with different permissions that govern the users' access to objects.
- It is not known beforehand (at the time of Authorization Model creation) what the application roles are.
- The team responsible for building the authorization model is different from the teams responsible for defining roles and access to the application.

## Before you start

Before you start this guide, make sure you're familiar with some <ProductConcept /> and know how to develop the things listed below.

<details>
<summary>

### Initial Model

To start, let's say there is an application with a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="type" /> called `asset-category`. Users can have view and/or edit access to assets in that category. Any user who can edit can also view.

</summary>

We'll start with the following authorization model showing a system with an `asset-category` type. This type allows users to have view and edit access to it.

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'asset-category',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            union: {
              child: [
                {
                  this: {},
                },
                {
                  // Anyone who is an editor is a viewer
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'editor',
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

## Step By Step

Starting with the authorization model mentioned above, we want to enable users to create their own custom roles, and tie permissions to those roles to our two users and to the permissions on the logo asset category.

For this guide, we'll model a scenario where a certain organization using our app has created an `asset-category` called "logos", and another called "text content".

The company administrator would like to create:

- a **media-manager** role that allows users to **edit** assets in the **logos asset category**
- a **media-viewer** role that allows users to **view** all assets in the **logos asset category**
- a **blog-editor** role that allows users to **edit** all assets in the **text content asset category**
- a **blog-viewer** role that allows users to **view** all assets in the **text content asset category**

Imagine these are what the permissions the roles in one organization using our service are like:

![Image showing custom roles and permissions](./assets/custom-roles-roles-and-permissions.svg)

Finally, the administrator wants to assign **Anne** the **media-manager** role and **Beth** the **media-viewer** role.

At the end, we'll verify our model by ensuring the following access <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-check-request" linkName="check" /> requests return the expected result.

![Image showing expected results](./assets/custom-roles-expectations.svg)

In order to do this, we need to:

<ol className="list-numbered-leading-zeros">
  <li>Update the Authorization Model to add a Role Type</li>
  <li>Use Relationship Tuples to tie the Users to the Roles</li>
  <li>Use Relationship Tuples to associate Permissions with the Roles</li>
  <li>Verify that the Authorization Model works</li>
</ol>

### 01. Update The Authorization Model To Add A Role Type

Because our roles are going to be dynamic and might change frequently, we represent them in a new type instead of as relations on that same type. We'll create new type called `role`, where users can be related as assignee to it.

The authorization model becomes this:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'asset-category',
        relations: {
          viewer: {
            union: {
              child: [
                {
                  this: {},
                },
                {
                  // Anyone who can edit can view
                  computedUserset: {
                    relation: 'editor',
                  },
                },
              ],
            },
          },
          editor: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }, { type: 'role', relation: 'assignee' }] },
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }, { type: 'role', relation: 'assignee' }] },
          },
        },
      },
      {
        type: 'role',
        relations: {
          assignee: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            assignee: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

With this change we can add relationship tuples indicating that a certain user is `assigned` a certain `role`.

### 02.Use Relationship Tuples To Tie The Users To The Roles

Once we've added the `role` type, we can assign roles to Anne and Beth. Anne is assigned the "media-manager" role and Beth is assigned the "media-viewer" role. We can do that by adding relationship tuples as follows:

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: 'Anne is assigned the media-manager role',
      user: 'user:anne',
      relation: 'assignee',
      object: 'role:media-manager',
    },
    {
      _description: 'Beth is assigned the media-viewer role',
      user: 'user:beth',
      relation: 'assignee',
      object: 'role:media-viewer',
    },
  ]}
/>

We can verify they are members of said roles by issuing the following check requests:

![Image showing expected membership checks](./assets/custom-roles-membership-checks.svg)

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:anne'} relation={'assignee'} object={'role:media-manager'} allowed={true} />

### 03. Use Relationship Tuples To Associate Permissions With The Roles

With our users and roles set up, we still need to tie members of a certain role to it's corresponding permission(s).

<WriteRequestViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      _description: 'Users assigned the media-manager role can edit in the Logos assets category',
      user: 'role:media-manager#assignee',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'asset-category:logos',
    },
    {
      _description: 'Users assigned the media-viewer role can view from the Logos assets category',
      user: 'role:media-viewer#assignee',
      relation: 'viewer',
      object: 'asset-category:logos',
    },
  ]}
/>

### 04. Verify That The Authorization Model Works

To ensure our model works, it needs to match our expectations:

![Image showing expected results](./assets/custom-roles-expectations.svg)

<CheckRequestViewer user={'user:anne'} relation={'editor'} object={'asset-category:logos'} allowed={true} />

The checks come back as we expect, so our model is working correctly.
