# Get Started with Modeling

<DocumentationNotice />

This guide outlines how to define a <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" /> with <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ProductLink}/>.

## Introduction To Modeling

<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm} /> is built to quickly and reliably perform <ProductConcept
  section="what-is-a-check-request"
  linkName="authorization checks"
/>
, which answers ReBAC's basic question: "Can user U perform action A on object O?"

ReBAC systems determine access from a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="user's" /> <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="relation" /> to an <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="object" />. Authorization decisions are then yes or no answers to the question: "Does user U have relation R with object O?".

<ColumnLayout cols={2} style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox title="General Authorization Check" appearance="filled">
    "Can user <b>U</b> perform an action <b>A</b> on object <b>O</b>?"
  </CardBox>
  <CardBox title="{ProductName} (ReBAC) Authorization Check">
    "Does user <b>U</b> have relation <b>R</b> with object <b>O</b>?"
  </CardBox>
</ColumnLayout>

In the previous example, relation R is defined so permission to perform action A is implied. For example:

<ColumnLayout cols={2} style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox title="General Authorization Check" appearance="filled">
    "Can user <b>Jane</b> perform action <b>view</b> on object <b>project sandcastle</b>?"
  </CardBox>
  <CardBox title="{ProductName} (ReBAC) Authorization Check">
    "Can user <b>Jane</b> have relation <b>view</b> with object <b>project sandcastle</b>?"
  </CardBox>
</ColumnLayout>

While modeling, the general question to answer is:

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox
    icon={{ icon: <FGAIcon />, alignment: 'left' }}
    title="Why could user U perform an action A on an object O?"
  />
</div>

Answering that question for all object types in your system codifies your authorization model.

---

## A Process For Defining Authorization Models

Below is one iteration of defining an authorization model for your system, using a simplified Google Drive-like system as an example. The following are the steps for this iteration:

1.  [Pick the most important feature](#01-pick-the-most-important-feature)
2.  [List the object types](#02-list-the-object-types)
3.  [List relations for those types](#03-list-relations-for-those-types)
4.  [Define relations](#04-define-relations)
5.  [Test the model](#05-test-the-model)
6.  [Iterate](#06-iterate)

![The starting point](./assets/getting-started-diagram-01.svg)

### 01. Pick The Most Important Feature

![Pick the most important feature](./assets/getting-started-diagram-02.svg)

In this context, a **feature** is an action or related set of actions your users can perform in your system. Start your model with the most important feature and ensure you're familiar with its authorization requirements. 

:::caution Important

- Requirement clarity is fundamental when defining an authorization model.
- You can always iterate; the scope of the feature is not important.

:::

#### Write It In Plain Language

Describe your feature's authorization related scope in simple language; avoid using the word "roles" to train yourself away from RBAC-style thinking.

:::info
Roles don't "disappear" in ReBAC systems like <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> and your users might [have roles on a given object instead of the entire system](./roles-and-permissions.mdx). Discover roles while you are modeling instead of determining in advance which roles will be defined.
:::

Your feature description includes the <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-object" linkName="objects" />, <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="users" /> and <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="groups of users" /> participating in the system. Sentences look like this:

<div style={{ marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox
    title="A user {user} can perform action {action} to/on/in {object types} ... IF {conditions}"
    appearance="filled"
    centerTitle
  />
</div>
The following is a simplified Google Drive-like system focused on a feature allowing users to create, read,
update, delete, and share documents with other users.

<br />
<br />

This feature can be described with the following sentences:

<CardBox appearance='filled' monoFontChildren>

- A user can create a document in a drive if they are the owner of the drive.
- A user can create a folder in a drive if they are the owner of the drive.
- A user can create a document in a folder if they are the owner of the folder. The folder is the parent of the document.
- A user can create a folder in a folder if they are the owner of the folder. The existing folder is the parent of the new folder.

---

- A user can share a document with another user or an organization as either editor or viewer if they are an owner or editor of a document or if they are an owner of the folder/drive that is the parent of the document.

---

- A user can share a folder with another user or an organization as a viewer if they are an owner of the folder.

---

- A user can view a document if they are an owner, viewer or editor of the document or if they are a viewer or owner of the folder/drive that is the parent of the document.

---

- A user can edit a document if they are an owner or editor of the document or if they are an owner of the folder/drive that is the parent of the document.

---

- A user can change the owner of a document if they are an owner of the document.

---

- A user can change the owner of a folder if they are an owner of the folder.

---

- A user can be a member of an organization.

  <span style={{ color: 'gray' }}>
    How a user is added as a member to an organization is beyond the scope of the feature we picked to write down.
  </span>

---

- A user can view a folder if they are the owner of the folder, or a viewer or owner of either the parent folder of the folder, or the parent drive of the folder.

</CardBox>

### 02. List The Object Types

![List the object types](./assets/getting-started-diagram-03.svg)

Make a list of the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type" linkName="types" /> of objects in your system. You can likely identify the objects in your system from your existing domain/database model.

Find all the objects in the previous step using this template:

<div style={{ marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox
    title="A user {user} can perform action {action} to/on/in {object type} ... IF {conditions}"
    appearance="filled"
    centerTitle
  />
</div>

Returned are all the object types from the previous step (in order of appearance) based on that template:

<ColumnLayout cols={3} style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox icon={{ icon: <DocIcon />, alignment: 'left', label: 'Document' }} />
  <CardBox icon={{ icon: <DirIcon />, alignment: 'left', label: 'Folder' }} />
  <CardBox icon={{ icon: <OrgIcon />, alignment: 'left', label: 'Organization' }} />
</ColumnLayout>

Highlight all object types in <span className="blue-highlight-text">blue</span>:

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
<CardBox appearance='filled' monoFontChildren>

- A user can create a <span className="blue-highlight-text">document</span> in a drive if they are the owner of the drive.
- A user can create a <span className="blue-highlight-text">folder</span> in a drive if they are the owner of the drive.
- A user can create a <span className="blue-highlight-text">document</span> in a folder if they are the owner of the folder.
- A user can create a <span className="blue-highlight-text">folder</span> in a folder if they are the owner of the folder.

---

- A user can share a <span className="blue-highlight-text">document</span> with another user or an organization as either editor or viewer if they are an owner or editor of a document or if they are an owner of the folder/drive that is the parent of the document.

---

- A user can share a <span className="blue-highlight-text">folder</span> with another user or an organization as a viewer if they are an owner of the folder.

---

- A user can view a <span className="blue-highlight-text">document</span> if they are an owner, viewer or editor of the document or if they are a viewer, owner of the folder/drive that is the parent of the document.

---

- A user can edit a <span className="blue-highlight-text">document</span> if they are an owner or editor of the document or if they are an owner of the folder/drive that is the parent of the document.

---

- A user can change the owner of a <span className="blue-highlight-text">document</span> if they are an owner of the document.

---

- A user can change the owner of a <span className="blue-highlight-text">folder</span> if they are an owner of the folder.

---

- A user can be a member of an <span className="blue-highlight-text">organization</span>.

  <span style={{ color: 'gray' }}>
    How a user is added as a member to an organization is beyond the scope of the feature we picked to write down.
  </span>

---

- A user can view a <span className="blue-highlight-text">folder</span> if they are the owner of the folder, or a viewer or owner of either the parent folder of the folder, or the parent drive of the folder.

</CardBox>
</div>

To complete the list of object types, add all the second nouns that appear in conditions as part of expressions of this format: **"\{first noun\} of a/the \{second noun\}"**.

<div style={{ marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox centerTitle title="... IF {first noun} of a/the {second noun}" appearance="filled" />
</div>

Highlight those expressions in <span className="green-highlight-text">green</span>:

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
<CardBox monoFontChildren appearance='filled'>

- A user can create a document in a drive if they are the <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the drive</span>.
- A user can create a folder in a drive if they are the <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the drive</span>.
- A user can create a document in a folder if they are the <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder</span>. The folder is the <span className="green-highlight-text">parent of the document</span>.
- A user can create a folder in a folder if they are the <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder</span>. The existing folder is the <span className="green-highlight-text">parent of the new folder</span> .

---

- A user can share a document with another user or an organization as either editor or viewer if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner or editor of a document</span> or if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder/drive</span> that is the <span className="green-highlight-text">parent of the document</span>.

---

- A user can share a folder with another user or an organization as a viewer if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder</span>.

---

- A user can view a document if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner, viewer or editor of the document</span> or if they are a <span className="green-highlight-text">viewer or owner of the folder/drive</span> that is the <span className="green-highlight-text">parent of the document</span>.

---

- A user can edit a document if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner or editor of the document</span> or if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder/drive</span> that is the <span className="green-highlight-text">parent of the document</span>.

---

- A user can change the owner of a document if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the document</span>.

---

- A user can change the owner of a folder if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder</span>.

---

- A user can be a member of an organization.

  <span style={{ color: 'gray' }}>
    How a user is added as a member to an organization is beyond the scope of the feature we picked to write down.
  </span>

---

- A user can view a folder if they are the <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder</span>, or a <span className="green-highlight-text">viewer or owner of either the parent folder of the folder, or the parent drive of the folder</span>.

</CardBox>
</div>

The object type list is missing `Drive`, so we'll add it to the list. In addition, `User` must be added to establish the type of user who can create relations.

<ColumnLayout cols={5} style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox icon={{ alignment: 'left', label: 'User' }} />
  <CardBox icon={{ icon: <DocIcon />, alignment: 'left', label: 'Document' }} />
  <CardBox icon={{ icon: <DirIcon />, alignment: 'left', label: 'Folder' }} />
  <CardBox icon={{ icon: <OrgIcon />, alignment: 'left', label: 'Organization' }} />
  <CardBox icon={{ icon: <DriveIcon />, alignment: 'left', label: 'Drive' }} />
</ColumnLayout>

Now we define them using the <UpdateProductNameInLinks link="../configuration-language" name="{ProductName} Configuration Language" />:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  onlyShow={SyntaxFormat.Friendly2}
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'user',
      },
      {
        type: 'document',
      },
      {
        type: 'folder',
      },
      {
        type: 'organization',
      },
      {
        type: 'drive',
      },
    ],
  }}
/>

:::info Important

In a few cases, other users can determine whether one action can be performed on another action. For example, on social media, sometimes a user can comment on a picture if they are a friend of the user that published it.

In those cases [**User** must be an object type](./building-blocks/object-to-object-relationships.mdx), and you would discover the User type because it is a second noun in an expression `friend of the user`.
:::

### 03. List Relations For Those Types

![List relations for those types](./assets/getting-started-diagram-04.svg)

Each previously defined type has a set of relations. A process similar to that above to [list the type of objects in your system](#02-list-the-object-types) defines your system's relations.

Relations for a type \{type\} will be all of these:

- any noun that is the \{noun\} of a "\{noun\} of a/an/the \{type\}" expression. These are typically the Foreign Keys in a database, highlighted below in <span className="green-highlight-text">green</span>.
- any verb or action that is the \{action\} of a "can \{action\} (in) a/an \{type\}" expression. These are typically the permissions for a type, highlighted below in <span className="yellow-highlight-text">yellow</span>.

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
<CardBox monoFontChildren appearance='filled'>

- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can create a document in a drive</span> if they are the <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the drive</span>.
- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can create a folder in a drive</span> if they are the <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the drive</span>.
- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can create a document in a folder</span> if they are the <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder</span>. The folder is the <span className="green-highlight-text">parent of the document</span>.
- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can create a folder in a folder</span> if they are the <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder</span>. The existing folder is the <span className="green-highlight-text">parent of the new folder</span>.

---

- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can share a document with another user or an organization</span> as either editor or viewer if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner or editor of a document</span> or if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder/drive</span> that is the <span className="green-highlight-text">parent of the document</span>.

---

- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can share a folder with another user or an organization</span> as a viewer if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder</span>.

---

- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can view a document</span> if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner, viewer or editor of the document</span> or if they are a <span className="green-highlight-text">viewer or owner of the folder/drive</span> that is the <span className="green-highlight-text">parent of the document</span>.

---

- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can edit a document</span> if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner or editor of the document</span> or if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder/drive</span> that is the <span className="green-highlight-text">parent of the document</span>.

---

- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can change the owner of a document</span> if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the document</span>.

---

- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can change the owner of a folder</span> if they are an <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder</span>.

---

- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can be a member of an organization</span>.

  <span style={{ color: 'gray' }}>
    How a user is added as a member to an organization is beyond the scope of the feature we picked to write down.
  </span>

---

- A user <span className="yellow-highlight-text">can view a folder</span> if they are the <span className="green-highlight-text">owner of the folder</span>, or a <span className="green-highlight-text">viewer or owner of either the parent folder of the folder, or the parent drive of the folder</span>.

</CardBox>
</div>

The resulting list is:

<ColumnLayout cols={4} equalWidth style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
<CardBox
  smallFontChildren
  icon={{ icon: <DocIcon />, alignment: 'middle', label: 'Document' }}

</CardBox>
</ColumnLayout>

:::info
In <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>, relations may only use alphanumeric characters, underscores and hyphens. We recommend using underscore (\_) to separate words and removing prepositions, so `can create a document` becomes `can_create_document`.
:::

Enumerate relations for each type with the <UpdateProductNameInLinks link="../configuration-language" name="{ProductName} Configuration Language" />:

```dsl.openfga
model
  schema 1.1
type user
type document
  relations
    define parent:
    define owner:
    define editor:
    define viewer:
    define can_share:
    define can_view:
    define can_write:
    define can_change_owner:
type folder
  relations
    define owner:

  relations
    define member:

  relations
    define owner:
    define can_create_document:
    define can_create_folder:
```

:::info Caution
Though you're in the process of building a version you can use, the model above is not yet a valid authorization model accepted by <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/>.
:::

### 04. Define Relations

![Define relations](./assets/getting-started-diagram-05.svg)

Use the <UpdateProductNameInLinks link="../configuration-language" name="{ProductName} Configuration Language" /> to create a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="relation definition" /> for each of the relations we identified, then encode the answers to the question we asked at the beginning of the document:.

<div style={{ marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox
    icon={{ icon: <FGAIcon />, alignment: 'left' }}
    title="Why could a user U, perform an action A on an object O?"
  />
</div>

Go over each type and each relation, then create a definitions for them.

<div style={{ display: 'inline-block' }}>
<OrgIcon />
<div style={{ float: 'right', marginLeft: '16px' }}>

#### Type: Organization

</div>
</div>

Start from objects that represent groups/containers of users, like `team`, `group`, or `organization`. They are easy to define for features in most systems and help reason out the other types.

##### Relation: Member

The member relation tells <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> about the members of an organization.

:::info Important
Relation names in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> are arbitrary strings. There are no reserved relation names; you can use `member` or `part_of` or anything else to refer to a user that is part of a team/organization.
:::

Remember that how a user is added as a member to an organization is beyond the scope of this feature. For the purposes of this model the relation definition should be:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  onlyShow={SyntaxFormat.Friendly2}
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'organization',
        relations: {
          member: { this: {} },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            member: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }, { type: 'organization', relation: 'member' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
  skipVersion={true}
/>

This relation definition states:

- That organizations have members
- That the members of an organization with id \{id\} are all users described by tuples of the form below:

  `{ user: {user-id}, relation: "member", object: "organization:{id}" }`

:::info Important
Relation definitions of the form `define \{relation\}: [user, organization#member]` are common and are used to express that relationships to the object with that relation (meaning users of type `user` or `member of organization`) can be assigned by your system. The only users with that relation are those with a [direct relationship](./building-blocks/direct-relationships.mdx).
:::

You can read more about group membership and types in [Modeling User Groups](./user-groups.mdx).

You must determine the object types that makes sense for the relationship tuples' user when creating direct relationships. In the organization example, it makes sense for member relations to have user of type

- user
- organization#member (i.e., other organization's member)

However, it does not make sense for an organization member's user to be of type `document`, `folder`, or `drive`. We specify this logic as part of a <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-directly-related-user-type" linkName="directly related user type" />.

:::note Note
This also automatically supports nested organizational membership. You can use relationship tuples like the following to express that members of organization A are members of organization B:

```
{ user: "organization:A#member", relation: "member", object: "organization:B"}
```

To learn more, see [Modeling User Groups](./user-groups.mdx) and [Managing Relationships Between Objects](../interacting/managing-relationships-between-objects.mdx).
:::

##### Complete Type Definition

The complete <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-type-definition" linkName="type definition" /> for the **organization** type is:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  onlyShow={SyntaxFormat.Friendly2}
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'organization',
        relations: {
          member: {
            this: {},
          },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            member: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }, { type: 'organization', relation: 'member' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
  skipVersion={true}
/>

<div style={{ display: 'inline-block' }}>
<DocIcon />
<div style={{ float: 'right', marginLeft: '16px' }}>

#### Type: Document

</div>
</div>

After defining your "group" like types, continue with the most important type for the feature: the one that allows the main use case. In this case "document", since the main use case for users is to create, write, read and collaborate on documents.

Defining relations for the main type lets you to focus on your core use case, and will likely make other type definitions easier.

##### Relation: Owner

The owner relation is used to tell <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> which users are owners of the document.

:::info Important
In the current version, there is no way to state that there is only one owner in the authorization model. The application must limit this <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-user" linkName="set of users" /> to just one owner if that is a requirement.
:::

When a document is created, a relationship tuple will be stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> representing this relationship between owner and document. This is an example of a [user to object relationship](./direct-access.mdx).

The relation definition then should be:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  onlyShow={SyntaxFormat.Friendly2}
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          owner: { this: {} },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            owner: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }, { type: 'organization', relation: 'member' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
  skipVersion={true}
/>

Why? This <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="relation definition" /> states that:

- each document can have one or more owners
- owners of a document are assignable by creating a tuple of the format
  `{ user: "{user_id}", relation: "owner", object: "document:{id}" }` for individual users

##### Relation: Editor

The editor relation is used to tell <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> which users are editors of the document.

When a user shares a document with another user or set of users as editor, a relationship tuple will be stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> representing this relationship between editor and document. This is an example of a [users to object relationship](./direct-access.mdx).

The relation definition then should be:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  onlyShow={SyntaxFormat.Friendly2}
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          editor: { this: {} },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            editor: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }, { type: 'organization', relation: 'member' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
  skipVersion={true}
/>

Why? This relation definition states that:

- each document can have editors
- the editor(s) of a document are assignable by creating a tuple with shape
  `{ user: "{user_id}", relation: "editor", object: "document:{id}" }` for individual users

This also supports making all members in an organization editors of the document, through a [group to object relationship](./user-groups.mdx). A relationship tuple like the following one states that the members of organization A are editors of document 0001.

<RelationshipTuplesViewer
  relationshipTuples={[
    {
      user: 'organization:A#member',
      relation: 'editor',
      object: 'document:0001',
    },
  ]}
/>

You can learn more about this in [Modeling User Groups](./user-groups.mdx).

##### Relation: Viewer

The viewer relation is similar to the document's [editor relation](#relation-editor). It will be defined like this:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  onlyShow={SyntaxFormat.Friendly2}
  configuration={{
    schema_version: '1.1',
    type_definitions: [
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          viewer: { this: {} },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            viewer: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'user' }, { type: 'organization', relation: 'member' }] },
          },
        },
      },
    ],
  }}
  skipVersion={true}
/>

##### Relation: Parent

The parent relation is used to tell <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> which folder or drive is the parent of the document.

:::caution Important
Relation names in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> are arbitrary strings. There are no reserved relation names. You can use "parent", "container" or "ancestor" to refer to a "parent folder".
:::

This relation is different from the others we have seen so far, as it is a relation between two objects (a **folder** and or **drive** that is the parent of the **document**). This is known as an [object to object relationship](./building-blocks/object-to-object-relationships.mdx), of which [parent-child is a particular case](./parent-child.mdx).

When a document is created a relationship tuple will be stored in <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> to represent this relationship between parent and document. The relation definition then should be:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  onlyShow={SyntaxFormat.Friendly2}
  configuration={
      {
        type: 'document',
        relations: {
          parent: { this: {} },
        },
        metadata: {
          relations: {
            parent: { directly_related_user_types: [{ type: 'folder' }, { type: 'drive' }] },
          },
        },
  }}
  skipVersion={true}
/>

Why? This relation definition states that:

- documents may have a parent
- the parent(s) of a document with id \{id\} is either a folder or a drive, described by one of these relationship tuples:
  - `{ user: "folder:{id}", relation: "parent", object: "document:{id}" }`
  - `{ user: "drive:{id}", relation: "parent", object: "document:{id}" }`


We can use [direct type restriction](../configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions) to ensure a document's parent can only be an object of type either drive or folder.

:::note Side note
You might have noticed that the "user" in the tuple is an object. This is a special syntax <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> accepts in the "user" parameter to write [object to object relationships](./building-blocks/object-to-object-relationships.mdx). You can read more about writing data to manage object to object relationships in [Managing Relationships Between Objects](../interacting/managing-relationships-between-objects.mdx).

##### Relation: can_share

We need to express the following in the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="relation definition" />:

_A user can share a document with another user or an organization as either editor or viewer if they are an owner or editor of a document or if they are an owner of the folder that is the parent of the document._

We can achieve that with the following definition using <UpdateProductNameInLinks link="../configuration-language" name="{ProductName} Configuration Language" />:

<AuthzModelSnippetViewer
  onlyShow={SyntaxFormat.Friendly2}
  skipVersion={true}
  configuration={
    {
      type: 'document',
      relations: {
        can_share: {
          union: {
            child: [
              {
                computedUserset: {
                  object: '',
                  relation: 'owner',
                },
              },
              {
                computedUserset: {
                  object: '',
                  relation: 'editor',
                },
              },
              {
                tupleToUserset: {
                  computedUserset: {
                    object: '',
                    relation: 'owner',
                  },
                  tupleset: {
                    object: '',
                    relation: 'parent',
                  },
                },
              },
            ],
          },
        },
      }
  }}
/>

There are a few key things here:

- **We don't use a [direct relationship type restriction](../configuration-language.mdx#the-direct-relationship-type-restrictions) as part of the definition.** can_share is a common example of representing a permission that is defined in terms of other relations but is not directly assignable by the system.
- The relation definition contains a [union operator](../configuration-language.mdx#the-union-operator) separating a list of relations that the user must have with the object in order to "be able to share the document". It is any of:
  - Being an owner of the document
  - Being an editor of the document
  - Being an owner of the parent of the document. Whether the parent is a drive or a folder is not important, as they both have an owner relation.

You can read more about the aforementioned items in [Modeling Roles and Permissions](./roles-and-permissions.mdx).

##### Relation: can_view

We need to express the following in the <ProductConcept section="what-is-a-relation" linkName="relation definition" />:

_A user can view a document if they are an owner, viewer or editor of a document or if they are a viewer, owner of the folder/drive that is the parent of the document._

Similar to the [can_share relation](#relation-can_share), we can achieve that with the following definition using <UpdateProductNameInLinks link="../configuration-language" name="{ProductName} Configuration Language" />:

                  relation: 'editor',
                },
              },
              {
                computedUserset: {
                  object: '',

              },

:::note

The <ProductName /> authorization model API and SDK only accepts JSON in its input. To convert from DSL to JSON, you may use the [FGA CLI](https://github.com/openfga/cli) to run `fga model transform`.

### 05. Test The Model

![Test the model](./assets/getting-started-diagram-06.svg)

Once you have defined your group like types and the most important type for your feature you want to ensure everything is working as expected. This means testing the model.

How? Remember from the introduction that **<ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.LongForm}/>'s** main job is to answer the question:

<div style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox icon={{ icon: <FGAIcon />, alignment: 'left' }} title="Can user U, perform an action A on an object O?" />
</div>

The <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> service does that by checking if a user has a particular relationship to an object, based on your authorization model and relationship tuples.

<ColumnLayout cols={2} style={{ marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem' }}>
  <CardBox title="General Authorization Check" appearance="filled">
    "Can user <b>U</b> <u>perform action</u> <b>A</b> on object <b>O</b>?"
  </CardBox>
  <CardBox title="{ProductName} (ReBAC) Authorization Check">
    "Can user <b>U</b> <u>have relation</u> <b>R</b> with object <b>O</b>?"
  </CardBox>
</ColumnLayout>

What we want is to ensure that given our current authorization model and some sample relationship tuples, we get the expected results for those questions.

So we'll write some relationship tuples and assertions. An <ProductName format={ProductNameFormat.ShortForm}/> assertion takes one of these forms:

1. user U **has** relation R with object O
2. user U **does not have** relation R with object O

Much like automated tests and assertions work for programming languages, you can use assertions to prevent regressions while you change your tuples and authorization model. Essentially, assertions help you ensure things work like you expect them to work as you iterate.

#### Write Relationship Tuples

The relationship tuples should represent real examples from your system with fake data.

At this point you haven't defined the drive or folder types, so you can only test things based on users or organization members' relationships to documents. Let's imagine an example setup and write the relationship tuples for it:

| System Action                                                                   | Relationship Tuple                                                                 |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Anne is a member of the contoso organization                                    | `{ user:"user:anne", relation: "member", object: "organization:contoso"}`          |
| Beth is a member of fabrikam organization                                       | `{ user:"user:beth", relation: "member", object: "organization:fabrikam"}`         |
| Anne creates document:1, becomes its owner.                                     | `{ user:"user:anne", relation: "owner", object: "document:1"}`                     |
| Anne shares document:1 with all members of the fabrikam organization as editor. | `{ user:"organization:fabrikam#member", relation: "editor", object: "document:1"}` |
| Beth creates document:2 and becomes its owner.                                  | `{ user:"user:beth", relation: "owner", object: "document:2"}`                     |
| Beth shares document:2 with all members of the contoso organization as viewer   | `{ user:"organization:contoso#member", relation: "viewer", object: "document:2"}`  |

Follow these steps to create relationship tuples.

#### Create Assertions

According to our [written down model](#write-it-in-plain-language) and the [relationship tuples](#write-relationship-tuples) from the previous step, these assertions should be specified:

Because anne is the owner of document:1:

- user **anne** has relation **can_share** with document:1
- user **anne** has relation **can_write** with document:1
- user **anne** has relation **can_view** with document:1
- user **anne** has relation **can_change_owner** with document:1

Because beth is a member of organization:fabrikam and members of organization:fabrikam are writer of document:1:

- user **beth** has relation **can_share** with document:1
- user **beth** has relation **can_write** with document:1
- user **beth** has relation **can_view** with document:1
- user **beth** does not have relation **can_change_owner** with document:1

Because beth is the owner of document:2:

- user **beth** has relation **can_share** with document:2
- user **beth** has relation **can_write** with document:2
- user **beth** has relation **can_view** with document:2
- user **beth** has relation **can_change_owner** with document:2

Because anne is a member of organization:contoso and members of organization:contoso are viewer of document:2:

- user **anne** does not have relation **can_share** with document:2
- user **anne** does not have relation **can_write** with document:2
- user **anne** has relation **can_view** with document:2
- user **anne** does not have relation **can_change_owner** with document:2

Follow these steps to create assertions.

#### Run Assertions

Run the assertions. They should all pass. If they don't you can use the query view to understand what is causing them to fail, and then update your authorization model and relation tuples accordingly.

Once all the assertions are working, you should continue the iterative process of working on your model.

### 06. Iterate

![Iterate](./assets/getting-started-diagram-07.svg)

We'll leave the exercise of defining the drive and folder relations, then adding relationship tuples and assertions to you. Once you are finished, check out the complete example to see how you did.

When defining the authorization model for your own system, you would continue iterating on the <ProductConcept section="what-is-an-authorization-model" linkName="authorization model" /> with the [next feature](#01-pick-the-most-important-feature) and so on.
