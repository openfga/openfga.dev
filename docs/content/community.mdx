# OpenFGA Community 

The OpenFGA community has a channel in the [CNCF](https://cncf.io) Slack.

If you don't have access to the CNCF Slack you can request an invitation [here](https://slack.cncf.io). You can join the community in the [#openfga](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C06G1NNH47N) channel.

You can also use [GitHub discussions](https://github.com/orgs/openfga/discussions) to ask questions and submit product ideas.
