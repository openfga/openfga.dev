We got to know each other better, helped new team members to get familiar with the project, hacked some code, had some fun with ax throwing, and loved Toronto\'s weather!\\n\\n![OpenFGA Team](../static/img/blog/fgn-2024-01-team.png)\\n\\n## KubeCon Europe 2024!\\n\\nWe got two presentations accepted in KubeCon Europe! \\n\\n- [Jonathan Whitaker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-whitaker-5a8b2484/) from Okta will talk about [Federated IAM for Kubernetes with OpenFGA](https://kccnceu2024.sched.com/event/1YeQD)\\n\\n- [Pauline Jamin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulinejamin/) from Agicap and [Andres Aguiar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaguiar/) from Okta will present on [Implementing Modern Cloud Native Authorization Using OpenFGA](https://colocatedeventseu2024.sched.com/event/1YFhM/implementing-modern-cloud-native-authorization-using-openfga-andres-aguiar-okta-pauline-jamin-agicap)\\n\\nWe\'ll also have a Project Kiosk, so if you plan to attend let us know and we can schedule some time together!\\n\\n## OpenFGA \u26a1\ufe0fEnlightning Session!\\n\\nOur own [Raghd Hamzeh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raghdhamzeh/) will join [Whitney Lee](https://twitter.com/wiggitywhitney) in a Tanzu \u26a1\ufe0fEnlightning session on **February 8th at 9am PT**.\\n\\nJoin their Youtube stream [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yTgtAzhvC28).\\n\\n## Visual Studio Code Integration Enhancements\\n\\nWe keep investing in improving our VS Code experience. The video below shows how, in addition to validating the model, we can validate the tuple content and the tests. \\n\\nWe are identifying:\\n\\n- Invalid object types, user types, and relations when defining tuples.\\n- Invalid object types, user types, and relations when defining tests.\\n- User id or object id that was not included in any tuple in check tests.\\n\\nThis helps authoring/testing models, making the whole process less error prone and more fun!\\n\\n![VS Code](../static/img/blog/fgn-2024-01-vscode.gif)\\n\\n## CLI improvements\\n\\nWe love the FGA CLI and we keep making it even better. \\n\\nWe had a few of contributions from new team members and the community :).\\n\\n- You can now import tuples from a CSV file. We supported JSON/YAML, but if you are exporting data from a database, producing to CSV is way simpler. \\n- You can take a .fga.yaml file with a model and tuples, and get it imported in OpenFGA.\\n- Added support for specifying an external tuple_file in .fga.yaml files.\\n- Added support for specifying a continuation_token when calling fga tuple changes.\\n- Support for configuring OAuth scopes to authenticate to OIDC servers.\\n\\nCheck the updated documentation in our [CLI repository](https://github.com/openfga/cli)\\n\\nThanks to [Yann D\'Isanto](https://github.com/le-yams) for all your help on this!\\n\\n## OpenFGA v1.4.3\\n\\nWe just shipped OpenFGA [v1.4.3](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.4.3), with performance improvements and [one security issue](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-rxpw-85vw-fx87) fixed. We recommend everyone to upgrade to the latest release.\\n\\n## SDK Improvements \\n\\nNew releases with bug fixes and improvements:\\n\\n- [Java SDK v0.3.2](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk/releases/tag/v0.3.2). If you are using the Java SDK please upgrade to this version.\\n- [Go SDK v0.3.4](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk/releases/tag/v0.3.4)\\n- [Python SDK v0.4.0](https://github.com/openfga/python-sdk/releases/tag/v0.4.0), which has breaking changes.\\n\\nThanks again to [Yann D\'Isanto](https://github.com/le-yams) for your help on the Java SDK!\\n\\n## Language Improvements\\n\\nThe DSL language now has better support for comments and mixed operator support, where you can use parentheses to group expressions when defining relations:\\n\\n![DSL improvements](../static/img/blog/fgn-2023-12-language.png)\\n\\nIt\'s available in the VS Code extension, the CLI and the Playground.\\n\\n## Github Actions\\n\\nWe shipped a couple of Github Actions that help you deploy FGA models, and run model tests as part of your CI/CD build. Find them [here](https://github.com/marketplace?query=openfga).\\n\\n## What\'s Next? Check our RFCs!\\n\\nWe\'ve been discussing with the OpenFGA community a couple of RFCs that we are planning to implement in the next few weeks:\\n\\n- [Support for modular models](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/pull/14).\\n- [ListUsers API](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/pull/15).\\n\\nPlease take a look at them and let us know what you think!\\n\\n## OpenFGA Community \\n\\nWe have a very welcoming community, and we\'d love to have you there! You can join us in different ways:\\n\\n- Join our [community meetings](https://github.com/openfga/community/blob/main/community-meetings.md), the second Thursday of every month.

Yeah, we are slow thinkers!\\n\\nYou can expect to find here a summary of what we\'ve been up to, what we are planning to do, and some other random stuff we think you might find interesting.\\n\\n## Team News\\n\\nWe always start our Monthly Community Meetings presenting the team. If you attended the last one, you\'ve seen that the size of the team has grown quite a bit! We are pretty excited about the impact it will have in OpenFGA and the authorization space in general. \\n\\n## Behavior Driven Development with OpenFGA\\n\\nIn our last Community Meeting, the [Agicap](https://agicap.com/en) team (Pauline and Yann) demoed how they are using OpenFGA to implement Behavior Driven Development (BDD) in their authorization system.\\n\\nThe screenshot below might be enough to understand what they are doing, but if you want to know more, you can watch the full presentation [here](https://youtu.be/xXhwPPcGRqE?t=765).\\n\\n![bdd demo](../static/img/blog/fgn-2023-12-bdd.png)\\n\\n## GoDaddy & OpenFGA\\n\\nGoDaddy has been working with OpenFGA for a few months. They just published a document explaining why they picked OpenFGA, and how they used to address the authorization challenges they were facing.\\n\\nSome interesting tidbits:\\n\\n- They implemented their own DynamoDB Storage Adapter, as they were heavy Dynamo DB users and liked the eventual consistency model it provided.\\n- They needed [Contextual Tuples](https://docs.fga.dev/modeling/basics/contextual-time-based-authorization#use-contextual-tuples-for-context-related-checks) to fully support their use case.\\n\\n\x3c!-- markdown-link-check-disable --\x3e\\nRead the full article [here](https://www.godaddy.com/engineering/2023/12/12/authorization-oauth-openfga/).\\n\\n## Canonical & OpenFGA\\n\\nCanonical has also been working with OpenFGA for a while, and it\'s adding OpenFGA to different layers in their stack. \\n\\n![OpenFGA at Canonical](../static/img/blog/fgn-2023-12-canonical.png)\\n\\nThey just announced that OpenFGA support is included [in LXD](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/lxd-5-20-has-been-released/40865) and [MicroCloud](https://www.gamingdeputy.com/canonical-unveils-microcloud-a-toolkit-for-rapid-cluster-deployment/).\\n\\nPretty soon, if you are using Ubuntu Pro, you will be using OpenFGA :).\\n\\n## OpenFGA v1.4!\\n\\nLast week we released OpenFGA v1.4! This release includes our support for Conditional Relationship Tuples, which helps implementing additional Attribute-Based Access Control scenarios like temporal access, IP based access, bank transfer limits, SaaS application plans, and much more!\\n\\nYou can read more about it [here](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/conditions).\\n\\n## SDK Improvements\\n\\n- The [Java SDK](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk) has now feature parity with the rest of the our SDKs. It can be used from any language for the Java VM. You can see examples on Kotlin, Groovy and Scala [here](https://github.com/booniepepper/openfga-java-sdk-preview/tree/core/src/main). \\n\\n- The [Python SDK](https://github.com/openfga/python-sdk) was updated to support synchronous clients, support custom SSL certificates, and better performance in batch checks.\\n\\n## Language Improvements\\n\\nWe\'ve been working on the OpenFGA language with some long-due improvements. Soon, you\'ll be able to use parentheses to group expressions when defining relations:\\n\\n![DSL improvements](../static/img/blog/fgn-2023-12-language.png)\\n\\nThe syntax is still not supported in the FGA CLI, but we are pretty close. Daniel demoed it in our latest community meeting, you can see the full demo [here](https://youtu.be/xXhwPPcGRqE?t=1313).\\n\\n## VS Code Extension Improvements\\n\\nWe have also been improving tuple validation when writing `fga.yaml` files, and it\'s pretty cool!

For instance, you might declare that users are allowed to view a document if they have permission to view its parent folder.\\n\\nAlthough ReBAC offers a highly flexible method for structuring permissions, it encounters difficulties with defining permissions based on attributes that are not easily represented as relationships. Attributes such as \u201cparent folder,\u201d \u201cdepartment,\u201d \u201cregion,\u201d and \u201ccountry\u201d can be conceptualized as relationships between two entities. However, attributes like \u201cIP address,\u201d \u201ctime of day,\u201d \u201cteam size limit,\u201d or \u201cmaximum amount for a bank transfer\u201d cannot be easily handled.\\n\\nIn our ongoing efforts to expand OpenFGA\u2019s capacity for articulating a broader range of authorization policies, we are introducing **Conditional Relationship Tuples**. These allow for the specification of conditions under which a particular tuple is relevant when evaluating an authorization query.\\n\\nConsider the following example, where we utilize Conditional Tuples to grant access for a user over a specified time duration. We stipulate that a user may be granted either unconditional access or access constrained to a certain time period:\\n\\n```dsl.openfga\\nmodel\\n  schema 1.1\\n\\ntype user\\n\\ntype document\\n  relations\\n    define viewer: [user, user with non_expired_grant]\\n\\ncondition non_expired_grant(current_time: timestamp, grant_time: timestamp, grant_duration: duration) {\\n  current_time < grant_time + grant_duration\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf we write the following tuples:\\n\\n| user | relation| object| condition | \\n|------|---------|-------|---|\\n| user:bob | viewer| document:1| |\\n| user:anne | viewer| document:1| `name` : `non_expired_grant`, `context` : \\\\{ `grant_time` : `2023-01-01T00:00:00Z`, `grant_duration` : `1h` \\\\} |\\n\\nYou\'ll get the following results for the [Check](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Check) operations below:\\n\\n| user | relation| object| context | result |\\n|------|---------|-------|---|---|\\n| user:bob | viewer| document:1|  | `allowed` : `true` |\\n| user:anne | viewer| document:1| `current_time` : `2023-01-01T00:10:00Z` | `allowed` : `true` |\\n| user:anne | viewer| document:1| `current_time` : `2023-01-01T02:00:00Z` | `allowed` : `false` |\\n| user:anne | viewer| document:1 | | `error` : \\"failed to evaluate relationship condition \'non_expired_grant\': context is missing parameters \'[current_time]\' |\\n\\nYou\'ll get the following results for the [ListObjects](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/ListObjects) operations below:\\n\\n| user | relation| object| context | result |\\n|------|---------|-------|---|---|\\n| user:anne | viewer| document:1| `current_time` : `2023-01-01T00:10:00Z` |  `objects`: `[ \\"document:1\\"]` |\\n| user:anne | viewer| document:1| | `error`: \\"failed to evaluate relationship condition \'non_expired_grant\': tuple \'document:1#viewer@user:anne\' is missing context parameters \'[current_time]\' |\\n\\nNote that:\\n\\n- `user:bob` will always get `allowed:true` as we has assigned as as viewer unconditionally.\\n- `user:anne` will get `allowed:true` if the `current_time` is before the `grant_time` + `grant_duration` and `allowed:false` otherwise.\\n- If you don\'t provide the `current_time` in the context, the Check and ListObjects operations will fail.\\n\\n## Use Cases\\n\\nThe [OpenFGA Sample Stores repository](https://github.com/openfga/sample-stores) has several examples that take advantage of this new feature:\\n\\n- [Granting access during a specific period of time (the use case explained above)](https://github.com/openfga/sample-stores/tree/main/stores/temporal-access).\\n- [Allow access based on the user\u2019s IP Address](https://github.com/openfga/sample-stores/tree/main/stores/ip-based-access).\\n- [Granting access based on group membership and resource attributes](https://github.com/openfga/sample-stores/tree/main/stores/groups-resource-attributes).\\n- [Allow access to specific features based on usage](https://github.com/openfga/sample-stores/tree/main/stores/advanced-entitlements).\\n- [Determine if a user can make a bank transfer based .on the transaction amount](https://github.com/openfga/sample-stores/tree/main/stores/banking).\\n- [Data types and operations supported in conditions](https://github.com/openfga/sample-stores/tree/main/stores/condition-data-types).\\n\\n## How to use it?\\n\\nConditional Relationship Tuples are included in OpenFGA 1.4.0-rc1 version. You can run it by pulling it from docker:\\n\\n```shell\\ndocker pull openfga/openfga:v1.4.0-rc1\\ndocker run -p 8080:8080 -p 8081:8081 -p 3000:3000 openfga/openfga:v1.4.0-rc1 run`\\n```\\n\\nOpenFGA has a rich ecosystem of developer tools. The following have been updated to support Conditional Relationship Tuples:\\n\\n- [Visual Studio Code integration](https://github.com/openfga/vscode-ext) which provides syntax highlighting and model validations for conditions.\\n\\n- Beta versions of the [Javascript SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@openfga/sdk/v/0.3.0-beta.1) and the [Go SDK](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk/releases/tag/v0.3.0-beta.1), which allows using the additional parameters.\\n\\n- The [OpenFGA CLI](https://github.com/openfga/cli) allows validating models and runing tests that use conditional tuples. You can use it to test the new features by pointing to a `\u201c.fga.yaml\u201d` file that [defines the tests you want to run](https://github.com/openfga/cli#run-tests-on-an-authorization-model), without having to deploy OpenFGA.\\n\\n## What\u2019s Next?\\n\\nWe\u2019ll address some limitations of the current implementation:\\n\\n- The [Expand API](https://openfga.dev/api/service#/Relationship%20Queries/Expand) does not consider conditions.\\n- The Visual Studio Code integration is not validating the expressions in conditions. \\n- The Playground does not let you add context for tuples and assertions. You should use the VS Code Extension + the FGA CLI to test your models for now.\\n\\nWe\'ll also improve ListObjects scenarios when it\'s called with missing context.  For example, consider the following model that enables access only to documents with a specific status:\\n\\n```dsl.openfga\\nmodel\\n  schema 1.1\\n\\ntype user\\n\\ntype document\\n  relations\\n    define can_access: [user with docs_in_draft_status]\\n\\ncondition docs_in_draft_status(status: string) {\\n  status == \\"draft\\"\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIf you want to list all the documents a user can view, you\'ll need to know the status of all of those documents. Given you don\'t know the documents the user has access too, you can\'t send the status of those as a parameter to ListObjects.\\n\\nOur goal is to return a structure that you can use to filter documents on your side, similar to:\\n`(document.id = \u20181\u2019 and document.status = \u2018draft\u2019) or (document.id = \u20182\u2019 and.status = draft)` <br />\\nThis won\u2019t scale to a large number of documents, but would be useful in some scenarios.\\n\\n## Reach out!\\n\\nWe want to learn how you use this feature and how we can improve it! \\n\\nPlease reach out through our [community channels](https://openfga.dev/community) with any questions or feedback."},{"id":"kubecon-na-2023","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/kubecon-na-2023","source":"@site/blog/kubecon-na-2023.md","title":"Join the OpenFGA team at KubeCon NA 2023","description":"OpenFGA at KubeCon","date":"2023-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 12, 2023","tags":[{"label":"conferences","permalink":"/blog/tags/conferences"},{"label":"kubecon","permalink":"/blog/tags/kubecon"}],"readingTime":0.885,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Andres Aguiar","title":"Product Manager","url":"https://github.com/aaguiarz","imageURL":"/img/blog/authors/andres.jpg","key":"aaguiar"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Join the OpenFGA team at KubeCon NA 2023","description":"OpenFGA at KubeCon","slug":"kubecon-na-2023","date":"2023-10-12T00:00:00.000Z","authors":"aaguiar","tags":["conferences","kubecon"],"image":"https://openfga.dev/img/openfga_logo.svg","hide_table_of_contents":false},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Conditional Relationship Tuples for OpenFGA","permalink":"/blog/conditional-tuples-announcement"}},"content":"As you\'d expect, the OpenFGA team will be at KubeCon NA 2023 in Chicago, IL!\\n\\nWe\'ll have a packed agenda for the week:\\n\\n- [Jonathan Whitaker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-whitaker-5a8b2484/) and [Lucas K\xe4ldstr\xf6m](https://www.linkedin.com/in/luxas/) will be presenting in [Could_Native Rejects](https://cloud-native.rejekts.io/) on how to use OpenFGA to manage and extend authorization in Kubernetes.
