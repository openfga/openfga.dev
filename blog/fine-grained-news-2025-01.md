# Fine Grained News - January 2025

Welcome to the first Fine Grained News edition of 2025! January is always a good month to look back at what the OpenFGA community accomplished over the past year.

## Major faatures

Below is a list of the major features that were shipped in 2024:

- [Modular Models](https://openfga.dev/docs/modeling/modular-models)
- [Java Spring Boot Integration](https://github.com/openfga/spring-boot-starter)
- [JetBrains Integration](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24394-openfga)
- [Telemetry in OpenFGA SDKs](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/configure-telemetry)
- [ListUsers Endpoint](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/perform-list-users)
- [Batch Check Endpoint](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/relationship-queries#batch-check)
- [Query Consistency Options](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/consistency)
- [Storage adapter for SQLite ](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/configure-openfga#sqlite), contributed by [DanCech](https://github.com/DanCech) from Grafana Labs
- [Experimental Access Control for the OpenFGA server](https://openfga.dev/docs/getting-started/setup-openfga/access-control)

We heavily invested in OpenFGA performance, reducing latency by 90% in several cases. We'll continue improving performance in the following months.

## But that's not all!

We are very grateful with the OpenFGA community, who helped shipping **126** releases and improvements across the board:
