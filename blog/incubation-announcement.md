# OpenFGA Accepted into CNCF Incubation 🎉

We are thrilled to announce that the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Technical Oversight Commitee (TOC) has voted to accept OpenFGA as as **Incubation** project! This milestone reflects years of community work and real world adoption.

- CNCF announcement: [OpenFGA becomes a CNCF Incubating Project](https://www.cncf.io/blog/2025/11/11/openfga-becomes-a-cncf-incubating-project/)
- TOC tracker: [Issue #1949](https://github.com/cncf/toc/issues/1949)

## Why This Matters

Incubation is a signal that a project is healthy, vendor neutral, and ready for broad adoption. It places OpenFGA on the same maturity path as OpenTelemetry, Keycloak, Artifact Hub and Backstage.

Learn more about [CNCF project stages](https://www.cncf.io/projects/).

## How We Got Here

- Community and learning. Two years of public community meetings, talks, and guides. Join us in [CNCF Slack](https://openfga.dev/docs/community) and find recordings on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@OpenFGA).
- Adopter validation through public adopter interviews.
- Grafana Labs joined the maintainer team.

A few highlights from the journey:

- More than 600 people have contributed PRs across the OpenFGA org
- 4,500 stars across OpenFGA repositories
- Breakout sessions and a kiosk at five KubeCon editions
- Monthly community meetings running consistently for over 2 years
- Production adopters include Canonical, Docker, Grafana Labs, Read AI, Agicap, Headspace, Zuplo, and Sourcegraph along with others
