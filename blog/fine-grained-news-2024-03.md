# Fine Grained News

Welcome to Fine Grained News, KubeCon Edition!

## KubeCon Europe 2024 was super-busy!

You can now watch online:

- An AppDeveloperCon session about [Implementing Modern Cloud Native Authorization Using OpenFGA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5NkJHeToEwo) where [Pauline Jamin](https://github.com/paulinejamin) and [Andres Aguiar](https://github.com/aaguiarz) go over how OpenFGA is helping Agicap to implement fine-grained authorization.

- A 7-min Lightning Talk about [OpenFGA: The Cloud Native way to implement Fine Grained Authorization](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7Me3OjFxJ0).

- [Jonathan Whitaker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-whitaker-5a8b2484/)'s talk about [Federated IAM for Kubernetes with OpenFGA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UaK1EnRgrng), demoing how to use OpenFGA and KeyCloak to implement fine-grained authorization in a Kubernetes cluster, in ways it's not possible today, like giving access to a user for 90 seconds.

- We also participated in [Canonical's Operator Day](https://app.myonvent.com/event/operator-day) sharing how Canonical is using OpenFGA, but the presentation is not online yet.

Also, thanks to everyone who stopped by the OpenFGA Kiosk in the Project Pavilion to share their feedback about the project or learn more about it!

## CNCF incubation

As you may know, the CNCF has three stages for projects: Sandbox, Incubating, and Graduated. OpenFGA is currently a Sandbox project.

We are very happy to announce that we just [applied for Incubation](https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/1276)!. We are excited about this step and will keep you posted on the progress.

## New Adopters

The OpenFGA community [maintains a list](https://github.com/openfga/community/blob/main/ADOPTERS.md) of products/projects/companies that are using OpenFGA in production. We'd like to thank thank the following adopters for adding themselves to the list in the last month:

- [Instill AI](https://www.instill.tech/)
- [Zuplo](https://zuplo.com)
- [OpenObserve](https://openobserve.ai/)
- [Datum](https://datum.net/)

If you are using OpenFGA in production, please consider adding your company/project to the list.
 
 ## Community News

- [Raghd Hamzeh](https://github.com/rhamzeh/) represented OpenFGA in an [episode on Authorizing Access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VyHbFwfrf04) within a series called "You Choose - Choose Your Own Adventure: The Treacherous Trek to Security”. This episode was comparing OpenFGA with Hexa and Paralus. OpenFGA was the project viewers voted for as most interested in being featured in a demo.

- [Sam Bellen](https://github.com/Sambego) published a [Google Drive example](https://github.com/Sambego/fga-drive-example/) using OpenFGA. It's a Next.js project, written in TypeScript and ready to deploy on Vercel.

- [Philipp Wagner](https://github.com/bytefish) is working on a [.NET example](https://github.com/bytefish/gitclub-dotnet) inspired by the Github model.

- [Pauline Jamin](https://github.com/paulinejamin) and [Geoffroy Braun](https://github.com/geoffroybraun) will present about [Infuser du métier dans les autorisations avec ReBAC](

## New Releases

We just shipped a [release candidate of Modular Models](https://openfga.dev/blog/modular-models-announcement), that makes it easy for multiple teams to collaborate in a single OpenFGA model. It requires the following components:

## Transitioning from Discord to CNCF's Slack

As we mentioned in the last edition, we transitioned out from Discord for OpenFGA and are now using the CNCF [OpenFGA Slack channel](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C06G1NNH47N). If you are not part of the CNCF Slack workspace, you need to join the [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io) first.

## See you next month!
