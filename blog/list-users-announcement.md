# New ListUsers API on OpenFGA

Today we are launching a new API for OpenFGA: ListUsers.

This API will answer the question "what users have relation X with object Y?". This will be useful, for example, in UIs that want to display the list of users that a resource has been shared with, e.g. the "share" dialog in Google Docs.

## How to use it?

ListUsers is available in the latest Release Candidate version of OpenFGA. To use it you need to download [v1.5.4-RC](TBD) of OpenFGA and enable the endpoint via the flag `--experimentals enable-list-users`. 

Be sure to check out the various configuration flags that were added, too.

## What's next?

We have plans to add a Streaming variant to this endpoint, which will allow you to get real-time results, as soon as they become available.

Our roadmap looks as follows:

1. Release candidate with experimental flag (now)
2. Addition of Streaming variant,
3. Stable release with experimental flag,
4. Stable release without experimental flag.

## We want your feedback!

We want to learn how you use this API and how we can improve it!

Please reach out through our [community channels](https://openfga.dev/community) with any questions or feedback.
