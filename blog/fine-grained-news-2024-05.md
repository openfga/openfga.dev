# Fine Grained News

Welcome to Fine Grained News, May edition!

## New Releases!

- We shipped the [a ListUsers API](https://openfga.dev/blog/list-users-announcement). ListUsers allows you to retrieve all the users that have a specific relation with a resource (e.g. all users that can view a document).

- In collaboration with [Yann D'Isanto](https://github.com/yann-disanto) we shipped a [plugin for JetBrain's IDEs](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/24394-openfga) to allow syntax coloring and validation of OpenFGA models. Together with the [Visual Studio Code integration](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=openfga.openfga-vscode) and the [Tree sitter grammar](https://github.com/matoous/tree-sitter-fga) from [Matou≈° Dzivjak](https://github.com/matoous/), OpenFGA has get great coverage for major IDEs and editors.

## What's Next

- We've identified a few areas where we can improve performance and we are actively working on them.
- We'll be [instrumenting our SDKs](https://github.com/openfga/roadmap/issues/41) to provide metrics / tracing and logging through OpenTelemetry APIs.
- We'll be adding [additional consistency options](https://github.com/openfga/roadmap/issues/54) for OpenFGA query APIs.
- We'll be working on adding [authorization for OpenFGA APIs](https://github.com/openfga/roadmap/issues/30).

Please check the items above and let us know if you have any feedback or idea.
