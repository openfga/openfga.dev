## **Just Shipped**

**Batch Check API:**  We've launched Batch Check API in OpenFGA v1.8.0! Batching authorization checks together in a single request will significantly reduce roundtrip network latency. In addition, v1.8.0 introduces support for Contextual Tuples in the `Expand` API, along with several performance improvements. [Read more in the Changelog...](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0)

## **Coming Up**

**SDK Updates:** Next, we'll be updating our SDKs to take advantage of the new endpoint, starting with Python and JavaScript. If you'd like to see another SDK prioritized, let us know!

Check out our [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/openfga/projects/1) to see what we're working on. Share your ideas and feature requests in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/openfga/discussions).
