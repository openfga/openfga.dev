# Fine Grained News - November 2024

Welcome to the November edition of Fine Grained News! As we enter the final stretch of 2024, there are exciting developments in the OpenFGA to share.

ðŸŒŸ We just hit 3,000 stars on the OpenFGA repo! A huge thank you to our incredible community for your support in building OpenFGA. Let's keep the momentum going! If you haven't yet, we'd greatly appreciate you [starring the repo](https://github.com/openfga/openfga) and pushing us toward 4,000 and growing our community! ðŸŒŸ

## Just Shipped

**Batch Check API:**  We've launched Batch Check API in OpenFGA v1.8.0. Batching authorization checks together in a single request will significantly reduce roundtrip network latency. In addition, v.1.8.0 also added support for Contextual Tuples in the `Expand` API, and included other performance improvements. [Read more in the Changelog...](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/compare/v1.7.0...v1.8.0)

## Coming Up

**SDK Updates:** We will be updating the SDKs next to take advantage of the new BatchCheck, starting  with Python and JavaScript. If you want to see an SDK prioritized, let us know!

Check out our roadmap to see what we're working on. Feature requests and ideas can be shared in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/openfga/discussions).
