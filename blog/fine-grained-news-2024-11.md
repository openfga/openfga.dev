## Just Shipped

**v1.8.1:** This release focuses on performance and monitoring enhancements. It introduces two new flags for better control over check operations, optimizes performance for TTU relationships with set operations, and expands metrics tracking with duration measurements. Additionally, deduplication logic has been added to the `BatchCheck` API, along with new logging fields for authz calls. Read more in the [Read more in the Changelog...](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.8.1)

For more about the new OPENFGA_CHECK_ITERATOR_TTL and OPENFGA_CHECK_CACHE_LIMIT flags, run `./openfga run --help`  

**Batch Check API:** Introduced in v1.8.0, the `BatchCheck` API significantly reduces network latency by batching authorization checks in a single request. With v1.8.1, deduplication logic increasing its efficiency further. v1.8.0 also added support for Contextual Tuples in the `Expand` API, time-based filtering in the `ReadChanges` API, and additional performance improvements. [Read more in the Changelog](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.8.0) or the [`BatchCheck` API docs](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/relationship-queries#batch-check).

## **Coming Up**

**SDK Updates:** We will be updating the SDKs next to take advantage of the new BatchCheck, starting  with Python and JavaScript. If you want to see an SDK prioritized, let us know!

Check out our roadmap to see what we're working on. Feature requests and ideas can be shared in [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/openfga/discussions).
