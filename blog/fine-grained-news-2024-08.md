# Fine Grained News

Welcome to the August 2024 edition of Fine Grained News! We are excited to bring you the latest updates, features, and community highlights from OpenFGA. 

## Just Shipped!

* **OpenFGA v1.6.0:** The [latest OpenFGA release](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/releases/tag/v1.6.0) enables support for [query consistency options](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/consistency) and includes additional performance enhancements.

* **Query Consistency Options in SDKs:** All OpenFGA SDKs now support specifying [a query consistency parameter](https://openfga.dev/docs/interacting/consistency) for OpenFGA query endpoints. Make sure to update to the latest versions of the SDKs and OpenFGA to take advantage of this feature.

* **Metrics Telemetry for SDKs:** We already supported OpenTelemetry metrics in the [Python](https://github.com/openfga/python-sdk/) and [Javascript](https://github.com/openfga/js-sdk/) SDKs. We’ve just added support in [the Java SDK](https://github.com/openfga/java-sdk/releases/tag/v0.6.1), and [the GO SDK](https://github.com/openfga/go-sdk/releases/v0.6.0).

## Security Advisory

We recently addressed a security issue, identified as GHSA-3f6g-m4hr-59h8, that was present in OpenFGA v1.5.7 and v1.5.8. This issue has been fixed starting v1.5.9, and we strongly recommend all users update to the latest version to ensure their systems remain secure. For more details, please refer to the [security advisory](https://github.com/openfga/openfga/security/advisories/GHSA-3f6g-m4hr-59h8) on our GitHub page.
